I am attempting to locate a historically accurate visual representation of 1989's political map, visually showing the divide of the former first and second Worlds in .KML or .KMZ file form.
The task has proven difficult through my own research, and thus (lacking time to create or dig) I'm turning to the collective crowd. This thread will be X-posted, but replies with viable x-post suggestions are equally useful!

For the sake of transparency, my positionality is that I am a graduating senior of Cleveland State University's History/Social Sciences program. My personal Historical focus is 20th Century World history through the contextual lens of Gender analysis (disparity), and I have particular interests in the topics of Housing, Poverty, and Geography. My curation project's position: a deep analysis of the 4/11/1989 Alexanderplatz Demonstration subsequent to the 9/11/1989 collapse of the Berlin Wall.

Being a firm adherent to making the digital humanities public, I would like to enable exhibit visitors here in Cleveland or anywhere connect via-web to see, touch, and feel while exploring the space and place of the 1989 Germany Democratic Republic.

If I remember correctly, some countries enforce arbitrary policies to promote diverse neighbourhoods through quotas (such as Singapore) but here in Ireland there is no such arbitrary policies because much of the accomodations are privately-owned and not state-owned. So how could governments encourage, rather than enforce, a mixed neighbourhood? I speculate that it might have to do with creating income-dependent housing?

This can be something that results from genuine cultural impacts on their upbringing from past immigrant culture on their family, but a significant number of people have nothing much to do with much else as a primary identity other than being American. Yet ""American"" as a defining cultural identity is usually, by my account, not recognized. It's almost as if people are more interested in what makes them different rather than the same.

The other thing I've noticed is that this is by and large NOT the case for black Americans. While there are people involved in Roots culture, black Americans have, perhaps as a result of arising from a heritage broken by slavery with limited view of any culture before that mess, mostly been interested in identifying with black Americans.

And I've noticed that some of the most resonant and uniquely American cultural creations have been products of black culture, such as jazz music and hip-hop. While both of these examples are inextricable from their African history, they are commonly regarded as American art. While jazz is not as popular as it used to be, hip-hop is extremely popular, across race boundaries. Particularly American sports like basketball and football also have high representation of black athletes. In general, it seems by my view that black culture plays a strong role in driving uniquely American cultural identity.

I'm interested if there are observations like this in sociological literature. While general appreciation of the impact of black culture on American culture broadly as a general topic are interesting, I'm mainly interested in the bolder claim that black culture has a special role in determining and understanding American identity.",,7ausld,,0,,false,1512216255,false,self,t5_2sml9,false,,,false,true,,/r/AskSocialScience/comments/7ausld/is_there_any_reading_on_blackness_in_the_us_as_a/,,,,,

I recently conducted a mail-out survey to random households.  I’m trying to figure out whether the results are representative of the overall population.  Using Census data for the same geography, there are a number of demographics that are too close for me to tell whether they’re representative or over/under represented.  Can anybody weigh in?  Here are the results:

* White, Census: 85.2%, Survey 90.9%
* Black, Census 9.2%, Survey 5.0%
* Asian, Census 1.7%, Survey 0.9%
* Two or more races, Census 2.2%, Survey 1.5%
* Hispanic or Latino, Census 4.0%, Survey 3.2%

* No vehicle available, Census 2.4%, Survey 3.2%
* One vehicle available, Census 18.7%, Survey 24.4%
* Two vehicles available, Census 43.9%, Survey 49.4%
 
Perhaps a better question is, is there a measurement that definitively determines whether a sample is representative or not?  Or is it totally fluid/up to interpretation?  It seems like whole numbers and percentages are both flawed.  A whole number difference between 1% and 4% seems very different from a difference between 81% and 84%.

But the irony is this - as much as there are some forms of violence and explicit imagery in some video games, you rarely find anyone blaming violent films for violent crimes considering that film and TV have existed much earlier before the video gaming industry even started around the 60s and 70s.

Any help?","The quick of it: It seems that ritual behavior, not given the proper context, can go wrong. I would like to argue this is because of the disregard for how certain ritual behavior came to be (tradition). Has there been any studies about the link between disregard for traditions and the corruption of ritual and therefore corruption of government and businesses?

____________________________________________________________

So here's the thinking that lead to the question, just in case that helps:

I've been focused on Confucianism and communitarianism academically, which seems to be more traditionalist than not. Philosophically, rather than in terms of purely scientifically, I want to argue that it is traditions that give meaning to ritual.

For example, in America one wears white to a wedding, black at a funeral, and shakes hands, while in China one wears red to a wedding, white to a funeral, and bows. This is because in America white traditionally represents purity, black represents death, and shaking hands is traditionally used to signify peaceful intentions, while in China one represents happiness, white represents death, and bowing is a sign of respect and defference.

These are all very small rituals, but still the reason they are done is because of tradition, that is tradition gives meaning to ritual. The tradition of red to represent happiness in China means that it would be proper to use red in a wedding (wishing the couple happiness). However, if one were to change history so that red would represent bad luck, it would be odd to have a red wedding in China.

However, let us take another traditional behavior, such as guanxi. Guanxi is generally implemented in order to form tight social bonds with one another, and is generally reciprocal. It can be said that, even for a Confucian, the contemporary use of Guanxi results and influences corruption in government and society. 

I would argue that the worst case of using guanxi is during the Sichuan earthquake that killed thousands, especially affecting schools in Wenchuan. Due to government contractors favoring businesses that had built up guanxi with them, faulty cement was used to build schools, which in turn led to the destruction of schools and the lose of life of many teachers and students. 

However, to use guanxi in this way is to disregard why Chinese culture has guanxi in the first place. While it is true that guanxi itself is inherently disagreeable in the west, the need to form strong social bonds (especially between family and certain friends) is inherent to Confucianism. But the role is not the benefit and be reciprocal, rather it is to behave in such a way that gives moral guidance and substance to that relationship. This famously corrupt case of guanxi would be because Confucianism has become dead in China, and the ritual's meaning is missing.

Guanxi can be used in ways that benefit both society and those in the the ritual, however. Take the case of Emperor Shun and the appointment of his morally bankrupt brother, Xiang, as a minister. This was not because Shun wanted to simply give benefit to Xiang at the expense of the people under Xiang's rule, but because it would be better to have Xiang be wealthy than for Shun to be wealthy and Xiang to remain a commoner. The purpose of this was not to give Xiang power, rather there were measures in place that made Xiang effectively powerless, but to ensure that Shun could utilize his moral standing in order to effectively make Xiang more moral (through Shun's influence).

While this is just a short explanation of a much more complicated story and philosophical dialogue, it stands to point out the traditional meaning of guanxi: forming strong social bonds in order to ensure moral development. At least for Confucians, to cast out one's brother rather than treat him kindly would be immoral, as well as blocking out said brother from being able to cultivate himself (Xiang eventually did reform). But for contemporary Chinese using the Confucian ritual, the disregard for the traditional meaning of the ritual, leads to not moral cultivation, but financial gain and mutual benefit and the cost of others. Thus, when tradition is disregarded ritual becomes free of meaning, which in turn leads to corruption.

Provided this argument, are there any studies that would indicate this is the case? How far can social science go when studying the effect of ritual and tradition to a certain society?",,7e498a,,0,,false,1512280786,false,self,t5_2sml9,false,,,false,true,,/r/AskSocialScience/comments/7e498a/i_want_to_start_studying_the_importance_of_ritual/,,,,,

I've looked through a number of threads on this sub trying to find a name for this pattern of behavior but I haven't found anything yet (I might not be searching for the right thing!). 

I've been around the internet for a decent amount of time now, since the early 90s, and I've seen this particular pattern of behavior manifest over and over again on forums, different social sites, really anywhere there's social activity, but particularly where there are rules to be followed and moderation. Some examples I can think of off the top of my head would be SA, YTMND, Fark, Digg, Reddit, a lot of smaller forums, and many open source technology projects.

What I've seen happen is that at first, the service is either new or just starting to grow in popularity and there's a positive momentum starting to build. People are sharing the service, talking about it, and there's a culture starting to form. At this stage things are pretty positive overall and moderation of the service isn't difficult. It's around this growth period that you generally see the moderators taking part in the discussions and their presence is even elevated to some degree, being treated with a sort of celebrity status.

At some point, whether it's during the later part of this growth phase or around an apex of growth, something happens. A minority group of dissenters starts to grow and participate at an accelerated rate. Strong egos, contradicting perspectives, and contrarian ideologies form a counter culture. Communities start to fracture and the need for more moderation ramps up. The celebrity status of the moderators often turns them into targets and their actions turn into a magnet for these participants.

It's at this point that most communities try to respond to the behavior because it's starting to threaten the service as a whole. The most common response has been banning users or prohibiting certain discussions or topics. The negative minority focus their efforts and a genuine interest in undermining the community begins. Sometimes that has taken the form of posting illegal content on the site, trying to spread negative content, disrupt the service, or often impede the other users using in the community. The resulting attrition usually ends with stricter rules and reactionary measures that serve the suggestive tone that the moderation being done is clandestine and oppressive to minority opinions.

This is where a lot of sites have faltered and either the majority of users left and went elsewhere, e.g., when the DeCSS stuff happened with Digg. The remaining group of negative participants decide to start using the rules against the service itself. They start intentionally misinterpreting the rules so that content that contributes to a healthy a community becomes controversial. If the content or users they target are removed, they feel successful of dismantling the community and are emboldened. If they're ignored or the content or users in question become a point of contention, even if temporarily, they also feel successful as it becomes a false example of the hypocritical nature of the service.

Eventually, more moderation is again needed, and over a period of time the contrarian perspective is folded into the community and results in a sort of fracture line that makes the whole thing a little more fragile. If the community is able to survive through this, it seems like the whole cycle starts all over again. Each time this happens, because of the remnants of the previous issue remain, it becomes easier for it to happen again, and the overall quality of the service diminishes until an event happens that is great enough to cause those fractured pieces to splinter and only a fraction of the community remains.

What really throws me for a loop every time I see this happen is how something like participation inequality plays into all of this. I don't know what the ratio of user engagement is for all of the popular services that have risen and fallen over the decades, but I can imagine it's not anywhere close to a majority of users. That so few can affect so many is both fascinating and terrifying imo.

I know this also extends into history and offline communities and there's likely a long list of examples where this happens, but history was a really weak spot for me in school, so I welcome any lists as well!

What I'd really like to know is if there's a name for this cycle.

Where communities become popular, negative sentiment grows, moderation increases, and eventually the communities deflate as a result of the toxicity. I want to know more about why this happens and find the research that has been done on the subject. I'd love to know what factors play into this, e.g., is there a cycle or trend in the age or sex of the users? Does geographical influence contribute? What about the methods of moderation or how the moderators interact with the users, etc...

Thanks for any suggestions!

I posted this question on /r/askphilosophy a few days ago, but didn't receive any answers to it there, so I figured I'd try giving it a shot here. Thank you in advance.

Considering his place in the history of sociology and philosophy, and the positive social methodology he formulated with model reference to physics, I've always had Comte filed away as a sort of uncontroversially positivist thinker. If viewed through the lens of the debate about the methods of social sciences found in the Positivist Dispute, I suppose that while neither the critical theory nor the critical rationalist crowds represented there actually conform to any meaningful notion of 'positivism' we might imagine, it would seem that by the lights of both, say, Adorno and Popper, Comte ought be considered *very much* a positivist.

But lately I've been hearing talk among fellow students as well as two of my professors that Comte's project is actually to be considered pretty thorough-goingly normative, even if he wouldn't admit to it. There main line of thinking seems to be that Comte has missed the fact that he's operating on strong (and implicit) normative motivations in his conceptions about what social science (""sociology"") ought to do with society (the development of ""Humanity""), and why physics gives us the best methods to carry out this program.

I'm still not very sure what to make of this, though; his staunch preoccupation with the ""how"" of the organization of social systems, his 'third stage' of the Course, his notion that any aspiring sociologist must first be well versed in biology (!), that social problems or disruptions are to be solved by the technocratic savant, and so on, seems to me to indicate that surely Comte is a positivist.

As I'm seeing it right now, the fact that one might find normative ""slip-ups"" in his thinking could probably better be explained with reference to the naïvety of this relatively early program of phil. of science and social methodology, rather than they being indicative of Comte having formulated a normative program without noticing it, or something like this.

I'm sure I'm missing something, though. Can anyone perhaps clarify what such a notion of Comte-as-normative might mean, and/or perhaps redirect me to some literature that deals with the matter?

Relations with Social Structure,"I'm intensely interested in the intersections of geopolitics, state building, foreign policy and IR, etc. with what defines the groups and populations that states interact with in order to affect policy. Examples are James C. Scott's Seeing Like a State or The Art of Not Being Governed. The latter argues that one can only understand the politics and political dynamics of SE Asia by understanding the geology as well as the social structure of every-day people. Akbar Ahmed's impeccable The Thistle and the Drone makes the strong argument that societies characterized by segmentary lineage social institutions have heavily influenced various state's political objectives and ability to effect policy. Russia had to deal with the Dagars/Avars; the Ottomans the Albanians, Montenegrins; Nigeria continues to struggle with its segmentary societies; and the spread of Islam has an interesting though poorly understood relationship with segmentary societies/pastoralism. Such societies have had strong impacts on the states they interact with - sometimes curtailing those state's ability to effect policy, sometimes supporting them.

This story is strong historically but continues today: Kurds are an everpresent problem to Turkey, Iraq, and the region, and will continue to do so; Somali state building must deal with the segmentary nature of their society; the current conflict in Yemen similarly reflects segmentary politics; and the War on Terror needs to be fought understanding the social structure and associated psychology. To ignore the segmentary nature of such societies means to completely misunderstand the phenomena of extremism we so thoroughly misunderstood as an ""Islam problem"". Policy effected with such a misunderstanding only produces further radicalization through several mechanisms. 

These two authors argue from an interesting point. Rather than reifying states and presupposing them, they're thoroughly constructivist in both the building of states as well as their politics. These however are mostly anthropologists (I consider Scott more of an anthropologist than a political scientist, though that's arguable). Should I be looking for political scientists doing similar work, who should I read?

Is reality truly subjective based on our perceptions?,"There is a quote by Ivanka Trump saying: 

*""Perception is more important than reality. If someone perceives something to be true, it is more important than if it is in fact true.""*

Personally, I do believe that perception is more important than reality because it influences us how we view reality.

This has been a question that many philosophers often questioned and this goes through the field of epistemology, ontology and other forms of metaphysics

Not only this was proven by Einstein's theory of relativity with regards to perception when it comes to time, but I think our perceptions of reality are constantly being influenced everyday in a variety of ways.

We have social norms and social values that may influence us how we perceive our ingroup members and our outgroup members.

We have influences by the media through the use of gatekeeping and sensationalism to influence how we view certain phenomena such as expressing shock or fear or perhaps even excitement or happiness.

We have politicians influencing our attitudes with subtle tricks such as body language or their choice of words of how they choose to direct their audience or how they choose to depict their opponents.

We have adverts influencing how we view one product from another like using adverts such cues that make the product appear welcoming and unique like for example, having a cigarette means that you are more macho than someone who is not *(for example)*

It's quite interesting that reality exists but reality is often very subjective because it is often influenced by a variety of factors, whether they are social, psychological, or maybe even biological.

Like for example - we are influenced on how we view the reality of a certain phenomenon based on what we see on the news or any kind of media like newspapers, TV or the internet. Or we are influenced based on our modelling of our favoured politicians *(based on Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory through modelling)* or how our social influences affect our attitudes which will further influence our behaviours and even perceptions of reality.

Or we are influenced how we act based on social factors like for example social stereotypes. They are the most simple but recognizable mental representations of particular individuals or groups and unless you are not exposed or familiar to that individual/group, you are more likely to view that phenomenon in a certain way *(like for example, if you believe the stereotype of black people as dangerous or hooligans, you may respond with fear or aggression towards them)*

But then again, this is coming from someone who does not study a social science",,7ff9xo,,0,,false,1512304710,false,self,t5_2sml9,false,,,false,true,,/r/AskSocialScience/comments/7ff9xo/is_perception_truly_more_important_than_reality/,,,,,

Background and Cognitive Ability: The Decline of the Social](https://www.amazon.com/Education-Social-Background-Cognitive-Ability/dp/0415842468), Gary N. Marks's argues that educational, occupational and economic achievements are primarily determined by individual , i.e. genetic, cognitive ability, as opposed to one's social upbringing which Mark's contests has a negligible impact overall. To quote from a [review](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304308423_Review_of_Gary_Neil_Marks_2013_Education_Social_Background_and_Cognitive_Ability_The_Decline_of_the_Social) by Artur Pokropek on educational achievement:

&gt;Marks continues to demonstrate that socio-economic inequalities in education are not as strong as often assumed by reproduction theory.
The relationship between an individual’s socio-economic background and test scores is typically small. The correlations are between 0.3 and 0.4, which is directly counter to the claims of reproduction theories that stipulate that socio-economic background is the most crucial (if not the only) factor that determines test scores.

I would like to enquire if there is any consensus in the sociological literature concerning which of these two factors, socio-economic upbringing and cognitive ability, plays the predominant role pertaining to the aforementioned outcomes?

* Social science in academia

* Famous debates

* Questions about methods and data sources

* Philosophy of social science
