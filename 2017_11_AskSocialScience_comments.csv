"I would say that structural violence is an aspect of institutional racism. This is the case if we take a relatively narrow definition of structural violence, such as James Gilligan's (Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic):

""the increased rates of death and disability suffered by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society, as contrasted with the relatively lower death rates experienced by those who are above them"".

The institutional racism of American society then, by this definition, consists of structural violence as there is [a death rate disparity between African Americans and white Americans.](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/02/health/african-american-death-rates-cdc-study/index.html)",,,,Fresh-Snow,,,1510497485,t5_2sml9,t3_7cept3,t3_7cept3,9,1512561116,0,0,dpphnyn,AskSocialScience,,,
"I am not knowledgeable about trends and quantitative data, but the UNHCR does have listed [among its solutions](http://www.unhcr.org/solutions.html) what is known as voluntary repatriation, which is basically returning home. I only mention this because it may serve as a good starting point so it can help you in your own research on the question.

There is a very simplistic answer to your question though: refugees go back when it is safe for them to do so.

[The UNHCR emphasises that voluntary repatriation is the preferred solution to the issue of refugees](http://www.unhcr.org/excom/exconc/4b332bca9/conclusion-protracted-refugee-situations.html), but there are other solutions (resettlement and local integration) of course because it is not always feasible. 


I'd like to emphasise that using data and trends, especially historical ones, is not a very good way to compare the current refugee situation. This is because each situation is different and voluntary repatriation will depend on the outcomes of conflict and current affairs in their country.

For example: obviously Syria is not safe or suitable enough for Syrian refugees to return to, [but many Somali refugees have been repatriated from Kenya.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-20819462)

"It isn't a social science question exactly. There is an international multilateral treaty (The 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees) which lays out the rights of refugees and the obligations states have towards them. The main principal is 'non-refoulement' - the idea that refugees should not be returned to a place where they have a reasonable fear of persecution. The first country to receive refugees has an obligation to host them. Generally they must do so until one of three durable solutions have been found: local integration (permanently settle in the host country), voluntary repatriation (return home), or third-country settlement (gets permission to live in a new country). I assume you are North American or European, so usually we receive people who have already been refugees in other countries. So when we receive them they are allowed to permanently settle in our countries. About 85-90% of refugees actually live in poor to middle-income countries, so what we see in North America and Europe is just a small sample of a very large world problem. According to the 1951 Convention, there is no limit on how many refugees a host country should accept, just how they should be treated. So a short answer to your question - if you live in a rich country, the refugees you see are probably soon-to-be-residents and aren't going anywhere.

"Source: I work with refugees for a nonprofit.

The answer is ""whenever they are ready."" Once they feel they can safely return home, then they are allowed to do so. This amount of time will vary wildly between each case, as every refugee's situation is different. Their official social services end after 3 months of being here (at least in my state). All of them are offered an optional pathway to citizenship after 5 years, but they are not required to take it.

As for the numbers on how long the average refugee will stay (or on if they don't leave), they might not be very meaningful to analyze. Some can retain refugee status for over 40 years. With this current crisis, it's too early to tell.

"I can provide you with evidence from the UK's experience of implementing tuition fees, it my not apply to all context but its an interesting case study. My information for this come from a paper title [The End of Free College in England: Implications for Quality, Enrolments, and Equity](http://www.nber.org/papers/w23888). An ungated PDF can be found [here](http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1501.pdf) and short a summary is [here.](http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/cp503.pdf)

Originally university in the UK was free but the Labour government brought in tuition fees up to £3000 which was later increased to £9250 by the coalition government under Cameron.

The change was driven in part because the system was seen as regressive as the people that benefited most from it were the middle and upper class, it was also meant that as demand for workers with degrees rose politicians had to find more funding.
When no additional funding was forthcoming the end result was limiting places or limit the amount spent per student, neither of which are attractive proposals.

After charging for fees you ended up with

* More students enrolling in university (This might not have necessarily been caused by raises in fees but it certainly wasn't limited by it either)
* More funding per pupil
* A lowering of the social economic divide in university attendance

Its also important to look at how the fees where implemented, instead of paying upfront student take out a loan which is only repaid when they earn over a certain threshold. The system at the moment is a bit like a tax rather than a loan, in fact there's been talk about actually turning it into a tax. There are also grants to help poor student manage finance whilst studying away from home.

Having said all this it should be noted that raising tuition fees has been politically unpopular, so unpopular that when they were raised to £9250 there were riots in the streets. One of the reasons Corbyn did so well in the last general election was his promise to abolition tuition fees.

Its left a lot of people with the impression that they will be saddled with debt all their life that they will never pay off. This is absolutely true and part of it is by design as it means that the burden doesn't fall on less disadvantaged student. People also make arguments based on principle, believing that important public goods should be funded by government not by private individuals.",,,,ToughAsGrapes,,,1511042202,t5_2sml9,t3_7djqng,t3_7djqng,3,1512784428,0,0,dq0q044,AskSocialScience,,,

"The short answer is that there is no hard line in the sand. For political polling, the rule of thumb is generally a 95% confidence interval within 2-3% of the mean. So if the survey finds  50% of respondents are male, there is a 95% chance that the population is in the range of 49-51%.

If we assume that your coverage error is nil and that your no response error is also nil, then we can focus on sampling error. For a very large population size , your response rate would be about right for a 90% CI within 10% of the mean.  So for the example above, the population would be between 45-55% men. If the census data is in that range, then you can call it representative. It doesn’t mean that your survey measures are precise though. The caveat is the confidence interval.

The tricky thing is that a question of representation can be asked for every measurement in the survey. To may be representing  male/female well but not income distribution.

"Despite all of its difficulties, the popular book ""Capital in the Twenty-First Century"" by Tomas Piketty largely explores the historical trends in inequality and advances a simple argument. Essentially, when the rate of return on investments outpaces economic growth, wealth will concentrate in the hands of the few. This is captured by his simplification of the cause of inequality (r &gt; g), where r is the rate of return and g is the growth rate. This exacerbates inequality because wealth, generally highly concentrated, will grow much more quickly than wages that go to a wider base of society. Here's a decent [summary](https://www.ft.com/content/0c6e9302-c3e2-11e3-a8e0-00144feabdc0) of the book.

Piketty's recommendation is to tax the wealth of the rich, therefore artifically lowering 'r' and then using those taxes to help boost 'g' with investments in human capital, infrastructure, and redistribution.

His analysis is problematic because he data is iffy, he doesn't directly support his main hypothesis, and many argue that he is underplaying the huge divergence in wages that we see in many globalized economies.

Another set of arguments focuses on the voting franchise and the fear of violence. This argument is probably best summarized by a very well known paper by economists Acemoglu and Robinson titled [Why Did the West Extend the Franchise? Democracy, Inequality, and Growth in Historical Perspective](https://scholar.harvard.edu/jrobinson/files/jr_west.pdf). Essentially, you can't just pay off the poor, and so you democratize and let more people enter politics as a commitment mechanism that you will continue to redistribute to the poor. They then show that extensions of the franchise lead to lower inequality.",,,,temecula_sunrise,,,1510739243,t5_2sml9,t3_7cmmd2,t3_7cmmd2,3,1512662864,0,0,dpuminr,AskSocialScience,,,

privileged individuals and families enjoying a disproportionate share of income, power, and
other valued resources. The term “stratification system” refers to the complex of social

the rules of allocation that distribute these goods across various positions in the **division of labor

In academic social science they matter **A LOT** because they determine what is in and out of bounds, and all of the good things the quote I cite above say.

In your day to day life is that particular definition of racism important? Maybe. Maybe not. But often you'll find that even if you think you have the 'colloquial' definition in mind, the person you're speaking with has something else entirely in mind.

"There's no such thing as ""the"" sociological definition of racism, so no, it's not necessary. Sociologists are interested in racism and thus need to define it to talk about it, and *those* definitions seem necessary or at least useful (because otherwise sociologists would have to talk around the term which would get clunky) but all sociologists do not get together and decide that racism means one thing, forever.

So for instance if you look at something like Winant's ""Race and Racism: Toward a Global Future,"" of course Winant needs a definition of racism to talk about racism.

"They can't, as far as I know. They can identify different ""states"" which an article cited by /u/the_Pwny_Xpress speaks of. 
 
&gt;Research in Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)

&gt;There is some evidence that the aforementioned neurobiological alterations may not be specific to a specific disorder but rather represent a trans-diagnostic phenomenon related to dissociation. Recent findings in DID [90•, 91•] resemble findings for D-PTSD, albeit intra-individual differences (instead of inter-individual differences) were observed: neurobiological responses significantly differed depending on whether DID patients were in a “hyper-aroused traumatic identity state” (with voluntary access to traumatic memories) or in their “normal dissociative identity state” (characterized by dissociative amnesia) [90•, 91•]. In the two studies by Reinders and colleagues (2006, 2014), DID patients showed elevated cardiovascular responses (heart rate and blood pressure) and stronger amygdala and insula activity, along with lower activity in cingulate gyrus, parietal cortex, and parahippocampus when exposed to a trauma script (versus neutral script) while being in their “hyper-aroused traumatic identity state” than in their neutral “hypo-aroused identity state” [90•, 91•]. In another study, DID patients exhibited increased perfusion in bilateral thalamus while being in their (apparently) “normal” state of identity compared to an (apparently) “emotional” identity state [92•]. More research is needed to clarify whether brain activity patterns may differ dependent on states (in the same individuals) or represent stable inter-individual differences, which may allow for a discrimination between diagnostic subgroups/categories [10].

I've seen summeries of other articles that talk about being able to identify different personalities via FMRI - apparently the patterns of brain activity are remarkably different. I just can't put my finger on where I saw it so take that with a grain of salt, or to a better search engine than I can work.

For extra bonus points, they don't *actually* know what a personality is, or how many a person should normally have. 

Remember, nobody goes to a psychologist because they are feeling entirely ok about how things are going in their world - especially if they are aware that how things work for them might be seen as non-neurotypical. 

All are data are drawn from the dysfunctional.

"&gt;I’m just looking for some science behind it.

A person-- male or female-- who is 13 years old is a child transitioning into adulthood in a process that is both physical / biological and mental / emotional. A 13 year old girl lacks the experience to make sound decisions about matters relating to sexuality, long-term consequences of behavior, and personal safety. And is legally unable to give consent.

There are many peer-reviewed articles available documenting the undeveloped or underdeveloped decision making ability of teenagers.

https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C18&amp;q=teenage+decision+making+and+brain+development&amp;oq=teenage+decision+making

So yes, a 13 year old girl would be considered a victim (of the 34 year old) in this case. Her undeveloped decision making ability and lack of judgment (deriving from a lack of experience) have been taken advantage of by an older person who is well aware of the 13-year old's age and level of life experience (or lack thereof).

Yes, he could have been prosecuted for this. Whether he received jail time would depend on statutory limits on sentencing for the particular charges in question.

"That helps a lot! Thanks! I think I'm starting to get it.

Would it be, although simplistic (for my ecologist brain), somewhat accurate to sum it up as: The technology advantage (guns and steel) becomes less critical when the civilization bringing them in starts trading them out so it's no longer a special advantage, and even with whatever advantages Europeans may or may not have had there was still a complicated game involved with many moving pieces to achieve expansion and different decisions *could* have had different consequences?

I think I'm beginning to see the argument. I still think that Diamond has the general trends right, but perhaps simplified it and overstated the importance of a handful of things? Hence the ""scientific porn?"" Sensationalized?

"That's a pretty good way to put it. Think of it almost like evolution. The old-fashioned ascent of man posters posit that we evolved progressing from inferior ape-like forms to superior human-like forms. But now we know that organisms are not adapted to some global optimum such that they are always inherently ""superior"" or ""inferior"" to any other given organism. Rather, organisms are adapted to their environment. Same with technology.

A simple example -- imagine you are hunting some rabbits and you can use wood or stone-tipped spears. The rabbits are going to run away and you don't have a lot of time. So you have two choices:

A. Make a stone-tipped spear: This requires you to go through the process of 1, finding raw material, 2, quarrying raw material, 3, Knapping the points, 4, hafting the points onto the shaft.

or

B. Making a wooden spear by whittling and carving a nearby branch with expedient tools.

The wooden spears are good enough to kill the rabbits, so why spend all that time making ""superior"" stone-tipped spears?

Similarly, with the Inca and the conquistadors (using this example just because I am familiar with it), there isn't a clearly defined superior and inferior technology. The Spanish have steel blades, but the Inca have obsidian-bladed clubs that are also extremely deadly and cause a shrapnel effect. It's extremely hard to heal the wounds from the obsidian blades.  The conquistador armor is better suited for combat on European battlegrounds, but cumbersome in the Andes, and many conquistadors swapped it out for Inca-style cloth armor. When it comes to guns, few of the Spanish forces carried them, and they also require a larger technological support system -- you need supplies of gunpowder and ammo that you don't need for clubs or swords. Horses were a big advantage for the Spanish at first. However, horses are good on flat terrain, and much of the Andean territory held by the Inca is as opposite as you could get from that. Their roads often had steps and required crossing very small suspension bridges. Fighting with horses on these roads proved difficult. So it's not really a clear-cut case of sword and gun &gt; club, steel armor &gt; cloth armor.",,,,Snugglerific,,,1510198014,t5_2sml9,t3_7b9ssp,t1_dpjus4l,1,1512452922,0,0,dpk27c0,AskSocialScience,,,

"Thanks for the reply.

I took a look at your links and they are interesting.  Ultimately, it seems that menswear sales are increasing, but in response, there is more effort marketing to men.

The first link notes that men are spending more than in the past but still not as much as women.  **Accordingly, only 25% of sales is menswear while 39% is still womenswear** (with things like footwear and children's clothing making up the remainder) - thus women still spend about 1.5x more. 

The second link suggests they spend more, which is definitely interesting.  However, one might wonder where the samples came from or how the questions were worded. The first survey listed was done by ""Boutique @ Ogilvy, a fashion public-relations firm."" and the second one was BudgetSenseApp.com, and the third by ""Thread, a virtual stylist service that matches buyers to outfits according to their tastes"" I think it's likely that these may have had a non-random sample. The article even provides a simpler explanation for the findings (their words)

&gt;A simpler, more likely explanation is that men make more money than women, so they can afford to buy more or better quality apparel. Men’s clothing might cost more because most of the fast-fashion brands that enable cheap shopping at high volumes primarily cater to women. Thus, there are few cheap outlets for menswear, and fewer retailers in general, which enables each to charge higher prices. There’s also the matter of workwear standards. Men have fewer acceptable clothing options for business attire—usually some combination of suits, slacks, ties, and button-downs—while women can be more creative with less expensive separates.

The third link simply reports one of the same studies noted in the second link (Boutique @ Ogilvy, a fashion public-relations firm.).  It is interesting that they found that, but given the first link contradicts that with what appears to be more robust global number, I would caution you to accept those findings as truth. 

-----

Now, to answer you questions more specifically.  To reiterate, clothing is a want that both men and women share, but the want is not equal in strength.  As that first link that you provide shows - womenswear still outspends men 1.5x globally.  And it's not just that link - [here's an article on an](https://qz.com/340418/menswear-thinks-its-really-unfair-that-people-only-talk-about-womenswear/) Euromonitor report (which is a robust and well respected academic resource) that states: **However. The women’s apparel market worldwide is worth approximately $700 billion, compared with $460 billion for menswear**

I hope that satisfies that.  

Addressing your second part of your question, will take a lot longer to really dive into.  Ultimately, as cliche as it may be - it's a complex interaction between nature vs. nurture.  Men care more about women's attractiveness than vice-versa - [a finding that is quite robust and is found cross-culturally](https://labs.la.utexas.edu/buss/files/2015/10/buss-1989-sex-differences-in-human-mate-preferences.pdf) 

Clothes are a way for women to look more attractive and thus marketers are able to advertise clothes as being able to make you more attractive. This cycle is self-reinforcing, constantly making the idea of being more attractive more accessible and subsequently providing products that can do so.  Of course, men care about this too - however women tend to care more about status - and thus men would be more likely to buy clothes that fulfil this motive. 

Hopefully that helps.

"I don't completely disagree with you. I think the work of the Ostroms (on governance of the commons) and Polanyi (on the privatisation of the commons in Britain) makes clear that context matters and that individual incentives are not everything. Hell, for a individual incentives to make sense you need people to conceive themselves as individuals, which might be a relatively recent phenomena. So yes. Point taken, context matters.

However, two things. First of all, form a historical context, it is not as if global capitalism has reigned supreme for the last few centuries. The USSR, and China too, as well their spheres of influence are not negligible experiments on the margins. They were real, large scale experiments in collective, planned economies that were incredibly repressive of any individual ownership, especially by peasants. The fact that within this context and with fear of eminent death and destruction (I don't have to tell you what the Communist party did with dissenters for most of its early decades), where collectivisation was seen as the only rational way forward, that within this context a village still dared to decollectivize their property in an attempt to get by says something about the power of individual over collective incentives.

Second of all, even if context matters, it is not entirely malleable. There are too many complex processes and unintended consequences of human action for us to just go ahead and create the world we would rather live in. I don't think the communist experiments of the 19th century failed because of a lack of imagination, but also because of the inherent contradictions of the system itself. It is not as if they did not try to make it work. 

Last but not least, I don't think that's cognitive dissonance. There's a difference between equality of opportunity and equality of outcome. I am arguing that complete equality of outcome is not efficient, productive or just. Now, the two are obviously linked, those with better outcomes might use that to increase their opportunity.

"This is an extremely interesting question with sophisticated methodological implications. A twist, I think, is that BMI (or obesity or waist circumference or however we might operationalize the outcome) tends to increase over the lifetime, so the real question may be does making it out of poverty change the trajectory of BMI --that is, ""bend the curve""-- rather than necessarily make it slope downward. 

There appear to be several studies (e.g. Ban et al 2017 PLOS Medicine 14) that in various ways show that being poor when you are young gives you (on average) a permanent disadvantage over people who were not poor in terms of these outcomes. There are a lot of different methodological angles on this answering somewhat different questions (I did not find a study that exactly addressed this question).

Keep in mind also that environment (such as neighborhood) may itself have important effects on individual overweight outcomes, and that it's possible that such effects are more important than their  individual analogues (such as income, wealth, etc). See Rachele et al 2017 in Preventive Medicine 105; Lippert et al 2017 in American Journal of Epidemiology 185.

It's also possible that the relationship between income and overweight in the population could change over time (Clement, 2017 in China Economic Review 44). Also, the patterns may be different for different sexes and races (Insaf et al 2014 in Preventive Medicine 67) or in different countries (especially in developing and developed countries) and for sub-populations within those countries (e.g.., rural v. urban). So, as usual, it's complicated.

"This is more a criticism of how the first few years of econ are taught in undergrad, imo. Perhaps a little too abstracted from reality, or rather, not clear enough in the importance of the assumptions the models are constructed in.  
  
For instance, there's relatively strong evidence that on a micro scale individuals will satisfice (bounded rationality) rather than optimise, but this kind of constraint isn't really touched until more advanced undergraduate courses. Meaning, someone who does the first two micro courses might think that it's a reasonable assumption that people always optimise their decisions.   
  
This gets much messier on the macro courses where a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing, and true depths of the assumption of ""free and efficient markets with no transaction costs"" is rarely explored. This is a useful framework for building models, but not a realistic one for applying them.

"If that's the criticism you want to make it's an oddly ahistorical one. [SFI has been central to developments in complexity economics and algorithmic game theory](https://www.santafe.edu/news-center/news/sfnm-arthur-complexity-economics) as you might expect given it's a continuation of the work done at Los Alamos national laboratory where Von Neumann developed modern game theory. Mechanism design as a path forward has largely been left behind and instead the core approach has been research into altruism, institutions and the formation of norms; a pathway considerably validated by several Nobel prizes including Ostrom (an SFI alumni and collaborator), Sen, and most recently Thaler. (It should also be noted that the SFI website is just a convenient place to access these articles because they have an open access policy for working papers and host them that their site).

 As well there's no functional difference between an n-player heterogeneous game theory model and an ABM. Both are simulation approaches which is exactly what I was referencing. Heterogeneous game models are still fairly niche but I don't think anyone is saying they are useless especially since the push in modelling especially since the behavioural revolution has been towards heterogenous boundedly rational agents; something which ABM's are uniquely suited for. Examples abound in Bowles [Micro textbook](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/7610.html). [What's more we're at the point where complete population models are possible on fairly modest computers. This has seen a sea change in the ability of researchers to publish in top journals](https://youtu.be/tlcbasKtZyg?t=2954).  For example [this paper by Geanakoplos et al](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.220.7061&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf) allows policy makers to control for different variables in the financial crash and shows that the largest single driver was lending policy. What's more likely is that acceptance and training in algorithmic game theory models is opening the door to another huge paradigm shift in economics towards the complexity economics model. It may not have the impact of the behavioural revolution but it's something we're going to be seeing a lot more of.

"The basic desire to gather and hoard resources is seen in many primates, so it is logical that humans could have an overactive desire to gather and hoard resources. Some people see this greed as an addiction because the more a person acquires the more dopamine is released. https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolution-the-self/201210/greed-the-ultimate-addiction


Other evidence seems to point to how ""negative"" emotions can encourage a person to be greedy:

&gt; greed ...as a means of dealing with the negative emotions that being treated badly engender. If I can't pay you back for being a jerk, my only option for feeling better is to be a jerk to someone else.
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-greed-begets-more-greed/

Others say that a tendency to be greedy is passed on by people that spend a lot of time and energy gathering resources, or are ""greedy"":

&gt;They competed for resources better than others, passed on more of their own genes, ...

&gt;However, human beings are gregarious creatures, wishing to band into mutual admiration societies and avoid inbreeding. We get together for protection, for support, to share the work necessary for survival, and to have someone to talk to.

...



&gt;The definition of greed is an extreme or excessive desire for resources, especially for property such as money, real estate, or other symbols of wealth. Here we run into two problems: defining excessive, and defining wealth, especially in terms of human psychology.

...

&gt;However, all these things are harmful only to the individual. How could a desire for wealth be harmful? Every person needs a degree of wealth to survive: you need to buy food, pay the rent, get clothing, transportation, haircuts, cable TV. Without money (a symbol of wealth, or rather a transportable symbol of resources necessary to survival) you could starve or freeze to death, something that is definitely harmful. In addition, the more wealth you have, the better the quantity and/or quality of the things it brings you can get. Again, how could a desire for wealth, and thus the things it gets you, be harmful?

&gt;The answer lies in the fact that humans are social and cultural animals, not just individuals. Although for the individual greed (a strong desire for wealth) is good, the social group that individual belongs to may think greed is bad for her. Note I say ""bad for her"" -- not necessarily bad for the society or the culture or the group, but for her, which is as good an opening as I can think of for going into the history of greed.

"Analysis on the effects of capital punishment  is a rather difficult thing to tackle because it is performed in different ways in different Nations and each of these Nations are vastly different culturally, socioeconomically etc. It would be incredibly difficult to find concrete commonalities in effect between say capital punishment in the U.S using lethal injection and hangings in Saudi Arabia for example. 
This being said the long continuing debate regarding CP has been wether it has a deterrent effect on crime. The problem with research on the subject is that the debate is so politically charged (in the U.S particularly where the majority of research is available) that it tends to depend on who you ask as to wether it has a deterrent effect or not. It is worth mentioning that States in the US without the death penalty have had consistently lower murder rates than those with it however, this is a perfect example of correlation rather than causation. Individual studies will, as mentioned previously, give you a variety of answers. There is some consensus within criminology that it does not have a deterrent effect but that may say more about the political leanings of social scientists rather than the evidence available. I would argue that the move in American debate on the subject during the 70's which saw the Republican party move from arguing for capital punishment based on deterrence and instead on victim 'closure' would indicate they thought the deterrence battle was lost but that is just my view. In 1988 there was a rather famous debate between George Bush senior and Micheal Dukakis where Dukakis (a staunch abolitionist) was asked if he would be for CP for a criminal if he murdered his wife, Dukakis responded 'I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.' Dukakis' hopes for becoming president effectively died at this point and the negative reception he garnered from the public due to this exemplifies how little people care about evidence and research when it comes to political debate. Regardless, I would encorouge you to question thoroughly anyone who says they can give you a concrete answer to the above question as capital punishment research really is a black hole of argumentation and bias. The below links/study are not intended to be a comprehensive or representative list of the research available but more to show the diversity of opinion on the subject.

""However, we find across three experiments that extreme protest tactics decreased popular support for a given cause because they reduced feelings of identification with the movement.

"Thank you for bringing up this excellent question, the short answer is probably yes, though causality is tough to identify.

/u/cerka covered that great article by Madestam et al., but to take a more broad perspective on protests it is worth looking into the work of Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan, building on the work of Gene Sharp and his seminal [The Politics of Nonviolent Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Politics_of_Nonviolent_Action).

Chenoweth and Stephan collect data on major maximalist (that is, attempting to change regime, other government overthrows, or territorial liberation) violent and nonviolent campaigns since 1900 to show that primarily *nonviolent campaigns are more successful than primarily violent movements*.

Peaceful protests work for two main reasons, among many others:

1. Peaceful protests have lower barriers to entry and thus higher participation levels. While violent protests can polarize and divide citizens, nonviolent campaigns can elicit mass participation. No single campaign in the time period that they studied failed after they achieved active and sustained participation of just 3.5% of the population.
2. When protest is violent, it can legitimize the state's use of force in response, unifying and thus protecting the regime. The state's use of force against nonviolent campaigns can delegitimize the state and even turn people in favor of the resistance movement.

Some caveats:

* This information refers to large, coordinated protest campaigns, not one-off movements. The latter are much harder evaluate because it is much more difficult to obtain reliable data (because of reasons of definition) on these events.

* What I have written about refers to nonviolent resistance in comparison to violent resistance--absolute levels of success of peaceful maximalist campaigns are low. However, because these campaigns are so rare (just hundreds in the last century and the beginnings of the 21st century) and so difficult to successfully complete, this information still provides evidence against the idea that protests ""do nothing.""

"«The elementary forms of the religious life» is the basis for his second perspective on solidarity, taking its foundation into the way we develop our understanding of life through the establishment/institutionalization of the categories of understanding (probably not the correct translation, it's my personnal translation from the french term : «catégories de l'entendement»). He establishes the two essential forms of categories through which we first started understanding the world, taking inspiration from anthropological works about indigenous people from the american west coast and pacific tribes. The first and most essential categorization he identifies is between the worlds of the profane and the sacred, a categorization permeating all societies. The relation and interaction between those two worlds (through social action) is where Durkheim proposes that actual solidarity is born.

"&gt;What's your experience in sociology? 

I studied it at University and have a bachelor degree with sociology as one of my majors. 

&gt;how do sociology theories work as compared to traditional scientific theories? Are they proposed, reviewed and them accepted or refuted or is it once a theory is proposed and gains enough attention, it just sticks?

Sure, the theory needs to be coherent to be accepted in a journal for publication. The problem is that one theory tends to fail at explaining everything and will typically have pros and cons when using it to analyse a particular situation. Other theories that are looking at the same issue might offer a better framework for understanding depending on the specifics of each case. It's really up to the individual to decide and then justify which theory they are applying. Unlike natural science, where we can make claims with relative certainty, social science is far more variable in nature so you end up with an array of theories to explain a topic, not just one that is reducible to natural laws.

&gt;Also, if structuralism has declined, what are the main focus in the field of sociology now?

Let me start by saying that, by decline, I mean it has lost the dominance over the field it once had. It's not defunct. Structuralists, given their account of society and emphasis on the structural influence on behaviour, often argue that social science can be conducted in the same way as natural science; there are fundamental laws we can study to predict social patterns. This was very popular in the mid 20th century and is often associated with positivist research methods. The rise of poststructuralist thought disrupted this as it was a way of explaining the counter-culture movements that were emerging at the time and the social effects of globalisation that people were beginning to experience that were largely absent in the structuralist era. Structuralism essentially had a difficult time accounting for the changes that were clearly occurring in the 1960's and onwards. This is my understanding anyway. It's still a useful perspective but, like any, it has pros and cons. The cons of structuralism just became more pronounced as we moved into the current era.

I can't speak for everyone, but it's common to see interpretivist methods and poststructuralist perspectives in sociology, moreso than it is to see structural perspectives at least. Foucault is more popular than Durkheim these days, put it that way. Other perspectives, like Marx and Weber etc, are of course still around. Durkheim seems to have faded the most. Functionalism is often regarded as an inherently conservative ideology since it often is used in such a way that assumes order currently exists. That said, anyone writing a paper like that is a shitty academic.",,,,gnarwar,,,1511509470,t5_2sml9,t3_7f22ok,t1_dq9dvo5,1,1512954426,0,0,dq9p1pw,AskSocialScience,,,

"The funny thing about this logic to me is that we seem to prefer two still-developing risk-taking teens to couple with each other, rather than one still-developing teen to couple with someone older who can mentor them and modulate their behavior.

It seems at least possible that there could be a potential benefit in pairing young/inexperienced/still-developing persons with older/more experienced/mature persons, who can guide their development in a very intimate way.

"This is likely based on cultural perceptions of age. Adolescence, in particular, is an incredibly mutable concept. Think pre-Industrial Revolution, pre-child labor laws — those ideas of age are different from ours. I expect our idea of age to get even more drawn out as higher and post-secondary education become more prevalent, especially graduate level, because high school as mandatory shifted our perception of 15-18 year olds.

Cultures which had a lower perception of adolescence and adulthood would see the age gap as “smaller,” if that makes sense. If today an adult is 18, there’s 2 years of adulthood for a 20 year old but 42 for a 60 year old. If a 30 year old is dating a 35 year old we don’t think anything of it, but a 12 year old dating a 17 year old?

"I was going to reply to several of the 9 comments that were here yesterday, they are all gone now.  Not sure why.  (Unless it is just my account the cannot see them.)

As I recall, one of the posts stated there is not much of a sociological Q here.  I believe there is.  Almost all people speaking against rape describe it as an act of violence.  That is a correct characterization, IMO, though perhaps in the small number of cases where there is legitimate disagreement as to whether consent was given, the term ""violence"" might be too strong.

Then *some* of the people speaking about rape go further and assert that men's lust has little, if anything, to do with rape and that the act is motivated instead by the rapist's desire to demean, dominate and abuse the woman.  

Rape cases fall across an extraordinarily wide spectrum; it seems fair to say both men's failure to control their lust and the other factors--which arguably have a malicious intent--have a role.

What does sociology think about the motivations of rape and their relative frequency of causation?",,,,Markdd8,,,1509822571,t5_2sml9,t3_7an3xd,t3_7an3xd,0,1512125839,0,0,dpcg42n,AskSocialScience,,,

"Thanks for the response! It somehow reminds me of the concept of opinion leader. Does it work ini similar way?

Also Qinhuangdi's question makes me wonder of something. Does SNA see the difference between platform (where it is distributed) and actor (who distribute it)? ",,,,Ikhtilaf,,,1509521415,t5_2sml9,t3_79umhr,t1_dp6hhq7,1,1512008797,0,0,dp6ikhq,AskSocialScience,,,
"It does work in a very similar manner to an opinion leader! One way of identifying opinion leaders would be to use SNA to look for actors in a network who express an opinion/behaviour/whatever that is then picked up afterwards by their neighbours. In general, one would expect opinion leaders to be in central positions, although it may be the case that not every central actor is an opinion leader. 

As for the second question, there are two broad ways to answer it. The first is the simplest. SNA can see a difference between platform and actor. One could model a bipartite network (a network made up of two kinds of nodes) consisting of actors, platforms, and memberships. Or, one could create a unipartite network that consists of just actors, with platform as a nodal attribute. Or one could make a multiplex network. There are many variations depending on the research question and the analysis one would like to perform. 

The second answer, which is more of an explanation of the first one, is that SNA is not really a theory like Marxism or Critical Race Theory. It is more like a framework for addressing questions that have certain underlying assumptions: 1) there is some kind of network of relations between things, and 2) the structure of that network is important. 

In this particular case, it would seem to make sense to think that viral posts/videos/messages spread through some kind of network, and the structure of that network is probably important. Thus, SNA is an appropriate framework for trying to understand the phenomenon. Because it is so broad, SNA can see a difference between platform and actor, provided the researcher cares to make that distinction. SNA may also not see a difference between the two if the researcher doesn't believe the distinction is important. 

This broadness also makes it really hard to nail down what SNA ""sees"" or ""says"". Aside from those two assumptions, SNA doesn't usually dictate much, but is rather informed by more specific theories that then drive how one approaches a problem. 

TL,DR: I've used a whole lot of words to say ""SNA doesn't tell you what to see, but it can make that distinction if the researcher thinks it should, and then provide a means of performing quantitative or qualitative research to further explore the issue.""

"Sorry, no. It's just not obvious that ""disregarding ritual"" (still don't know what you mean by that or what the relationship of ""ritual"" is to ""tradition"") is a characteristic that distinguishes traditionalist from non-traditionalist societies. 

Explaining your example, you still refer to ""what [guanxi] is *meant* to do,"" which supposes a set of beliefs that gave rise to the practices (or at least gave them staying power), but now you're saying those beliefs don't in fact matter to what you're asking about. It's quite confusing.

Are you asking whether, in the process of change when traditional societies modernize, one observes a pattern like this:

Modernization --&gt; Decline in traditional beliefs regarding social cohesion --&gt; Ritualistic social cohesion practices decline --&gt; Corruption arises

where these changes are a key driver of allowing corruption.

As opposed to something else, like...

Modernization changes incentives under which traditional ritualistic social cohesion practices arose --&gt; social cohesion rituals become incapable of maintaining social cohesion --&gt; Corruption increases

However, I'm pretty sure that your use of the word ritual is a misnomer or at least does not have a  clear meaning and your conceptualization of corruption is underdeveloped (e.g. maybe a practice that works well to promote social cohesion in a traditional society is in fact considered corruption in a modern society -- so as the society changed, did corruption increase or was it re-defined into existence?)

"It is pretty normal for free trade agreements to create programs for retraining. For example, [NAFTA-TAA](https://www.doleta.gov/programs/factsht/nafta.htm) was designed to reduce the impact of NAFTA on people that were hurt by the agreement:

The NAFTA-TAA Program provides affected workers with both rapid and early response to the threat of unemployment and the opportunity to engage in long-term training while receiving income support.

It is sometimes the courses themselves. I lived in an area the EU classed as deprived and started to pump money into. It brought a lot of vultures in the form of private contractors who would basically defraud the government by not providing the services. I took a PLC programming course. The trainer was teaching about 3 - 4 classes and we were lucky to see him more than for an hour a day. It was a case of learning from a book if you were actually interested. For the majority of the class who were steelworkers who'd been made redundant it was a social club. They were paid their wages as part of the redundancy agreement..so 30 of them sit in class and chatted for a year.

"I know those videos seem very complicated in the beginning but once you follow their steps it starts to make sense. Just do what they do, step by step, then you will have all your documents in ""Internals"". ""Nodes"" are for coding. Once you open a file in internals, you can choose any section of the text and code it according to your created nodes. When you get to the ""nodes"" section later on, you will see all those coded texts from different sources under one heading. 

Cases and classifications are for later uses when you want to divide the texts or your sources in a more concrete manner, such as sex, age, location etc. 

If there's a sample project in your Nvivo, open it and play with it, it taught me a lot as well. 

To give a simple example, I am working on a project about media interns and my nodes are school culture, hiring process, family, mandatory internship, critical engagement with internship experience, critical engagement with work ethic etc. I created those under nodes section in the program. Now, when I open a text that i had uploaded to Nvivo (just by dragging the file into program's internals section), I choose and right click the part that I want to code accordingly to my created nodes.

"It sucks. No shit. But towns die. It’s been happening forever. Fields stop producing, plants shut down, mines run out. It happens.

There is nothing that Trump can do to bring Appalachian coal jobs back. It’s actually *cheaper* to mine coal from western US states than it is Appalachia now. Appalachian mines are severely depleted. They are hard to get machinery in and out of and the coal transported to the places it needs to go from the mine. It’s not Just the world moving on, it’s that it’s no longer efficient to mine there. Global demand would have to be **so much higher** for natural market forces to even make mining there worth it. 

So, again, they can either take the job training programs and learn a new skill which likely involves moving, move out West and try to get a job in another mine, just kicking the can down the road, or they can stay where they are and live off of government assistance and whatever retirement savings they have. There just aren’t enough jobs that exist in those areas if the mines aren’t in operation. It’s inevitable.

"I think there's been a decent amount of work in psychology on the subject.  See, for example, things like [cognitive dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance), the [backfire effect](https://daily.jstor.org/the-backfire-effect/), or [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias).  While these are not my area of expertise, why individuals hold the beliefs they do, and are so combative when they are challenged, is well studied.  Enough so that many of the theories and concepts have made their way into popular understandings of psychology.  I think this is a good thing.

What is less good, is how little, as far as I am aware, social scientists studying groups or institutions have studied this sort of question.  Their are bound to be institutional factors, not just individual ones.  I have a colleague currently studying the relationship between the robustness of democratic procedures and political fanaticism.  His current hypothesis, which I am inclined to support, is that when democratic procedures work poorly (i.e. people do not feel as if they have much say in decisions that influence their everyday lives), they are less willing to compromise or form political alliances.  Fanaticism is seen as the best strategy to avoid consistently becoming a political looser.  The specific problem he is focusing on is that the idealization of expertise.  The idealization of expertise undermines the tenants of pluralism [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralist_democracy) [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralism_(political_theory)), meaning that it prevents people from being able to substantively participate in political discourse that directly effects them, because they lack expertise.  It also doesn't acknowledge the role of conflict in scientific study, meaning that it casts disagreement between experts in a simple ""right vs wrong"" narrative.  Of course, in such a scenario, there is little room to acknowledge how different experiences and values might result in two people coming to different conclusions about what to do, even given the same facts.  Thus, the result is that opponents must be wrong for ""you"" to be right.  Again, discourse is prematurely shut down.

That being said, his research is only just beginning, so these are just his initial hypotheses which he will be testing.  But they are grounded pretty well in established political and sociological theory.  So I think he is likely to at least be on the right track here.

If you want to learn a little bit more about the relationship between science, scientific expertise, and politics, I would start with the book ""The Honest Broker"" by Roger Pielke.  If you can get past pay walls, the work of Brian Wynne is informative as well.  His most well known work is [""Misunderstood Misunderstandings""](https://dourish.com/~dourishc/classes/readings/Wynne-Misunderstood-PUS.pdf) which examines the importance of ""lay expertise"" as a complement to scientific expertise in making political decisions, as well as how expert practices create distrust which in turn causes resistance to experts (in other words, ignorance is not the cause of resistance, as is often thought).

I would be very interested in any responses outlining institutionally oriented studies of this phenomenon that this post receives.  I hope I'm wrong that it has been under studied.",,,,9unm3741,,,1511279069,t5_2sml9,t3_7ei21p,t3_7ei21p,7,1512868072,0,0,dq56rpi,AskSocialScience,,,

"There are several points in the process where error can creep in.

What sampling  frame (list) did you use to represent the population? Are there issues of people in the population that are missing in the frame? People in the frame that are not in the population? The difference between the sampling frame and target population is coverage error.

How large is your sample? How big is the sampling frame? Is it a simple random sample, or did you stratify to ensure some sub populations were captured in the sample? The more diverse your population, the larger the sample size you need to ensure representativeness. The difference between your sample and the sampling frame is sampling error.

Of your sample, what was the response rate? Is it likely that significant difference exists between those who responded and those who didn’t? This is nonresponse error.

To the extent that you can quantify these types of error, you can weight the data to mitigate them. Are your results weighted in any way? Even the best weighting schemes are going to introduce some error. This is adjustment error. 

If you can get a handle on these sources of error, then you can calculate the precision in your estimates, and assess the Representation of your sample vis the target population. 

The key is knowing the probability of selecting someone into your sample. If you used a random number generator to pick names from a list, you have that information. If you ‘randomly ‘ intercepted people at a shopping mall, then you probably don’t.

"Well, I'll try to be somewhat brief!  
  
Traditional accounts of perception suggest that all the senses can detect are meaningless measurements of external energies. To use vision as the main example, it is said that the photoreceptors are only measuring the wavelength and intensity of the light. These low level measurements provide no meaning/information about objects in the world, and thus the conclusion is that all meaning is created inside the head, leading to the subjectivist accounts of perception. This kind of thinking leads to solipsism and skepticism, following from various ""thought experiments"" like Plato's Cave, Descartes' brain-in-a-vat, the Matrix, etc.  
  
Hence, the subject-object distinction (also the mind-body problem) has been a lingering problem in philosophy of mind and psychology. Gibson presented a radical alternative that eliminates the subject-object distinction, and eliminates mind-body dualism too.  
   
Gibson claimed that the stimulus for vision is not individual radiant light rays stimulating photoreceptors, but is instead the ambient optic array, or better, as we are always in moving, the optic flow field. Rather than writing a lot on what these means, it will hopefully be sufficient to link you elsewhere:

Gibson then further claimed that the visual system should be seen as operating as a functional whole: eyes, thalamus and cortex have evolved to detecting the inherently meaningful patterns in optic flow, and that vis a vis detecting these patterns, we directly perceive real properties of objects/surfaces in our environment. Meaning is to be found in the world not in the head. A great article by William Mace captures this line of thinking with the title ""Ask not what is inside the head, but what the head is inside of"".  
Here is a direct pdf link to that paper:  
https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrvMTLmdrXAhWhl-AKHfJcByAQFggnMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.trincoll.edu%2F~wmace%2Fpublications%2FAsk_inside.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw1hjkKs6L1XCD_iMCCo1y7p  
  
I say that it is consistent with radical embodied cognition because Gibson claims that perception occurs only through embodied perceptual systems that move about (act) within the environment. Gibson called this the perception/action cycle, ""We perceive in order to move, but we also move in order to perceive.""  
Finally a recent paper has attempted to use Gibson's approach to reject Descartes' famous maxim ""I think therefore I am"" which reflects the old dualist/solipsist kind of thinking by placing internal subjective experience as a first principle. These authors replaced it with ""I perceive and act, therefore I am here"" which connects Gibson's ecological approach with embodied, enactive, and extended cognition.

"Such research is presently being conducted in places where abortion is totally illegal, such as in Iran. Erfani, A. (2011). Induced Abortion in Tehran, Iran: Estimated Rates and Correlates.  International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health 37 (3), 134-142.

In this study, the author chose a random sample of women (or households) and interviewed people, presumably with strong guarantees of confidentiality. The key to such a method is very good random sampling, low or no nonresponse bias, strong confidentiality, and an adequate sample size. The size of the sample you need for a good population estimate depends on several factors, including the prevalence of the phenomenon (for a more rare phenomenon, you need a larger sample for a stable estimate), so you have to have a good guess about the prevalence before you design the study.

There are other methodological strategies. You can survey hospitals or healthcare providers to find the rate of people coming in with complications from illegal abortions. If you know that, and you have an estimate of the proportion of such abortions for which people seek medical care, you can work backwards to an estimate. This is the case with this study in Rwanda. Basinga, et al. (2012). 
Abortion Incidence and Postabortion Care in Rwanda. Studies in Family Planning 43(1). A similar approach was used in South Korea, where abortion is illegal, but it is performed anyway by doctors and hospitals (Ahn, et al. (2012). Estimates of induced abortion in South Korea: Health facilities survey. JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY RESEARCH 38(1).

With survey methods, if the topic is very sensitive, you can ask respondents about other people they know. And of course, you can combine methods to try to triangulate, as in Sedgh, et al. (2011) Studies in Family Planning 42 (3), who studied abortion in Burkina Faso.

"The other respondents have done, I think, a better job of directly answering your question than I could have. However, your experience with the descriptive studies isn't coincidence, in a 1997 article *Rethinking Racism: Toward a Structural Interpretation*, Eduardo Bonilla-Silva noted that most sociologists tend to depict racism as a belief or ideology, rather than as part of a larger racialized system. Such a view has several drawbacks, not least of which is that it's usually treated as a static phenomenon and analyzed in a circular manner. I suggest you read the article linked below, as it might help you and it takes advantage of **a** sociological definition. However, related to your question on instinctively applying the concept of power...simply put, power doesn't have a singular dictionary-style definition in sociological understanding because it doesn't occur in a vacuum and is manifest in a variety of ways that some might not interpret as such right off the bat.

"I can bring a little data to light on this question from the [World Values Survey](http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/). It's not the best survey, but it is wide-ranging and has global coverage, so it is interesting to look at some correlations.

We have 2 relevant questions on this survey:

* Perceived income within country, so a measure of their relative income on a scale from 1-10
* ""To what degree are you worried about the following situations? Not being able to give my children a good education"" which is measured on a 1-4 scale.

The main problem with this second question is that it conflates both the ability to pay and the interest in education, but nonetheless, let's see what relationships exist.

If we fit a simple linear model those who say they are the lowest end of the income scale (1), on average score 2.09 on the (1-4) scale of worrying about education, while the richest score a 1.81. That difference is very precisely estimated, but the effect is small. It looks like richer people globally are less worried about providing an education. Of course, this again is problematic due to the question conflating both issues.

But your question is, are lower income individuals in lower income _countries_ valuing education more? We can interact an individual's income with the GDP per capita of the country. If we do this and again fit a simple linear regression, we see the following relationship:

**How worried are you about being able to provide education for your child?**

 | Poor country (e.g. Yemen) | Rich country (e.g. Sweden)
---|---|----
Poor individual (2 / 10) | 2.30 | 1.62
Rich individual (9 / 10) | 2.01 | 1.70

Overall, people in richer countries tend to worry less about education than people in poor countries. Furthermore, in poor countries, the poor tend to worry more relative to the rich while the reverse is true in rich countries, where rich individuals worry more.

**So it seems like this data seems to support your hypothesis, although the main confounder is that the poor in the poorest countries may be so poor they can't afford education, so we can't be sure if this is values or ability to pay.** This problem biases us in favor of supporting your hypothesis.

This isn't about why that might be, if it does exist.

Here's a review paper by two leading economists on the topic of rates of return to education: [paywalled](http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1574068405010075), [free pre-print](http://economics.mit.edu/files/521)

Most of the relevant story is told by [this table](https://imgur.com/XdNxQwk). In column 4, you will see a small but statistically significant negative correlation between GDP per capita and the rate of return on education. Essentially, increasing the GDP per capita by 1000 dollars is associated with a decrease in return on education by 0.08 percentage points. Here the outcome is percent return. If you look further up from that table you'll  see that the average rate of return is 8.65%  (i.e. each additional year of education is associated with a 8.65% increase in wages).

Now, the variation in rates of return is mostly between 7 and 13 percent if you look at table 1, so this probably wouldn't explain a huge difference in values, but nonetheless the difference does appear to be there.",,,,temecula_sunrise,,,1510579152,t5_2sml9,t3_7cjn8h,t3_7cjn8h,53,1512593245,0,0,dpr2d17,AskSocialScience,,,

"An insight from the same researchers: educational attainment, despite its perceived value, is far lower in the developing world. This is partly a mater of wealth, but it also relates to beliefs about education. From their field research, parents in poor countries tend to view the return on an additional year of post-secondary education as higher than the return on an additional year of secondary education, and so on. In reality, across the world, returns to education are constant. This misperception leads families in the developing world to see education as a lottery. Many pick their ""brightest"" child to give the lion's share of educational opportunities to, hoping that they make it to what they expect to be the realm of higher returns. All that is to say, valuing education doesn't always lead to pursuing education, thanks to quiet social forces.

"Could you cite the papers you are referring to? Because I am not sure how easy it is to measure a clearcut relationship between equality and economic productivity. Just taking a quick look at patent applications per million inhabitants and inequality in the OECD I don't see a clearcut relationship: South Korea, Japan, Switzerland, Germany and the USA are rank in the top five most innovative countries in the world, while they none of them crack the top 10 of most equal countries of the OECD (the rank 19th, 23th, 16th, 24th and 30th respectively).

Furthermore, I never claimed that more inequality is always a good thing. The actual relationship is likely more like a parabola. When there's too much equality (Communist China in the first few decades after WWII for example) there is no innovation. When there's too much inequality, that probably hampers innovation too. You need enough inequality in society to create incentives for work and innovation, but it also needs amply equality of opportunity. The relatively equal and innovative countries (in Scandinavia for example) probably hit a sweet spot around there. But that does not mean that if they become even more equal that economic outcomes will improve.",,,,ManWithAMasterplan,,,1510605376,t5_2sml9,t3_7befi4,t1_dpr4ni0,1,1512608258,0,0,dprqrdh,AskSocialScience,,,
"It sounds like you might be thinking of Paul Grice's cooperative principle, which consists of four maxims that he argues help to explain how we interpret what speakers mean as separate from the literal meanings of their utterances. One of the maxims is that your contributions to a conversation should (and tend to be) relevant (i.e., I take it, worth saying). For example, if you ask if I'm coming to the lunch tomorrow and I say I have to work, you naturally assume that I'm not just telling you an unrelated fact about how I manage to pay my bills every month. If it turned out that my shift tomorrow is at 4 pm and doesn't conflict with the lunch, you would (rightly) think I was being somewhat deceptive in our conversation, even though what I said was literally true. 

There's a lot more to it than that, of course, which you can read in ""Logic and Conversation,"" in *Syntax and Semantics, 3: Speech Acts* (1975), edited by Peter Cole and Jerry Morgan, or by googling 'cooperative principle' or 'implicature.' There are lots of good introductions out there. ",,,,mujahid69,,,1510607902,t5_2sml9,t3_7cpsrh,t3_7cpsrh,24,1512609839,0,0,dprtfy2,AskSocialScience,,,
"Coups are typically planned, initiated, and executed by a subset of the nation's elites. These elites generally wield considerable power in their own right; military officials &amp; officers, cabinet members, oligarchs, etc. 

This means that, while only a small number of people are **responsible**,  they often have the means to employ larger groups of individuals in seemingly legitimate capacities... It's only afterwards that the little guys learn they carried out calculated moves in support of the coup. Military deployments in response to ""civil unrest,"" real or imagined, would be the most obvious example of this unwilling recruitment for the coup.

There's also the consideration that being an ""elite"" implies some measure of fame and personal power, which is significant when considering who has access to heads of state and could more easily carry out a coup. For example, in the now-famous yelling match James Comey was involved in during the Bush administration, Comey was a well-known and moderately powerful *bureaucrat* who had nearly free access to the ~~president's~~ **Attorney General's** bedside while he was under anesthesia. Imagine what could happen if Comey, or the people he was yelling at in the hallway outside the president's hospital room, had actually been a part of a conspiracy? 

**(Correction: it was Attorney General John Ashcroft's bedside, not president Bush's. Removed most of the impact for this example, considering that Comey was *Deputy* AG at the time... So, yeah. My bad.)**

Because coups are reliant on precision, there's no minimum or maximum number of people that need to be involved. A medieval coup could be a son quietly removing their father to become the reigning King (a la Gladiator).

Other coups involve legitimately elected or appointed leaders remaking the government after they come to power; Hitler did this, as did the leaders of Kyrgyzstan, Belarus, and arguably, Russia, just to name a few. 

Long story short, there's no minimum or maximum number of people required for a successful coup, though there is certainly an average, and I have no idea what it would be. 

Edit:

Someone mentioned a lack of citations, so here's a few generally applicable ones. I'm currently on the road, but I can provide specific citations for the role of elite dissatisfaction in intrastate conflicts later on, if requested. I believe I also have a few saved on my computer if anyone is specifically interested.

"I’m not sure about industrial societies (it’s a hard thing to measure), but sexual morés among pre-industrial societies varied widely, with some (especially those in the Arab world) being very restrictive and others (especially those in the Pacific) being very permissive. *Patterns of Sexual Behavior*, from 1951, seeks to study the topic somewhat systematically. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterns_of_Sexual_Behavior). It’s obviously dated, but I don’t know a more recent text that tries to approach the problem as systematically. 

Regional cultures switch over time. Samoa, which was so permissive when Margaret Mead studied the region in the 1920’s, became much more conservative as it developed, mostly under the influence of austere forms of Christianity. This change helps explain one of the biggest anthropological controvery’s of the 1980’s: Derek Freeman’s sustained criticism of Mead and her *Coming of Age in Samoa*. The controversy is extended, you can see a short version on Freeman’s Wikipedia page and a longer version on the *Coming of Age in Samoa* Wikipedia page. 

From what I’ve seen, however, this region is an outlier and most areas sexually liberalize (to some degree) as they industrialize and post-industrialize, though it’s not necessarily a straight line and there may be moment where places do become more restrictive, at least for periods of time (often enforcing norms that were once for the middle class on lower class individuals, for example).

"I think a schism is definitely part of the ... whatever the ""bigger"" picture is, if there is such a thing. Take Reddit e.g., all the gaming subs that have splintered over time for one reason or another. I think some of those are definitely the result of a sub/counter culture upset with the status quo leaving one sub to create their own with their own set of rules. 

It seems like there's a broader trend that happens over and over, almost like an accumulation of negativity building pressure or something that generally results in a number of changes, a schism being one of them, until the responsible parties are gone and most, but not all, of their influence recedes. It may be anecdotal, but it seems like whatever influence remains has an effect on the process, reducing the time between each cycle proportional to how much negative sentiment remains in the community or is incorporated by the other members. That's the main reason I'm looking for any information on this is to try and have a better understanding of how this happens and to hopefully find some literature or research that might include some sort of model for this behavior.

The only other thing I've found so far that talks about the sort of broader trend in behavior is this article posted by someone on BuzzFeed. Just a quick disclaimer, I'm not supporting the political opinion in this article and if I could, I'd much rather have an objective example to provide, but this article talking about ""mod drama"" as she calls it, and the phases online communities go through is almost identical to what I've seen.

This is one data point, which suggests that GCC average of actual hours worked is the same as European countries, while non-GCC Arab countries log more actual hours of work than Europeans on average. 

There is the caveat that some of those hours are migrant workers (many of them non-Arab) in slave or near-slave conditions, which would likely bring up the average. But since UAE (traditionally one of major slave labor importers) lists *fewer* actual hours worked than both of the above, this might not be such a big factor (it's likely that much of the slave labor happens off the clock, or even off the books entirely).

"Your title is a little confusing. The social construction of facts implies a version of ""strong constructivism,"" which is a theory that argues that facts are completely socially constructed, meaning they have no correspondence to reality at all. You are not talking about the ""social construction"" of facts, but more about the construction of the presentation of facts.

For that, I would tell you to check out the [framing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)), which is a big part of behavioural economics and psychology. The book [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://books.google.nl/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=ZuKTvERuPG8C&amp;q=framing#v=snippet&amp;q=framing&amp;f=false) by Kahnemann has an abundance of examples.

As for your example, its probably better to go with ""30% believe it should be legal,"" because that sounds like a lot of people support it. ""70% believe it should be illegal"" makes it sound like there is a big opposition. But I would not just look at polling, but also at scientific findings. For example, and this is modelled on Kahneman and Tversky's work, ""in 90% of cases, marijuana has no negative side effects"" will likely lead to more support than ""in 10% of cases, marijuana has negative side effects"" even though they highlight the same underlying fact (these numbers are made up by the way).

"While I am not qualified to answer your question, it reminded me of a conversation between Hutcheon and Valdés (1998) I was reading recently. From Hutcheon:

&gt;Nostalgia, in fact, may depend precisely on the irrecoverable nature of the past for its
emotional impact and appeal. It is the very pastness of the past, its inaccessibility, that likely
accounts for a large part of nostalgia's power—for both conservatives and radicals alike. This
is rarely the past as actually experienced, of course; it is the past as imagined, as idealized
through memory and desire. In this sense, however, nostalgia is less about the past than about
the present. It operates through what Mikhail Bakhtin called an ""historical inversion"" (1981,
147): the ideal that is not being lived now is projected into the past. It is ""memorialized"" as
past, crystallized into precious moments selected by memory, but also by forgetting, and by
desire's distortions and reorganizations (Phillips 1985, 66).

[Hutcheon, L. and Valdés, M.J., 1998. Irony, nostalgia, and the postmodern: a dialogue. Poligrafías. Revista de Teoría Literaria y Literatura comparada, \(3\).](http://www.lpimentel.filos.unam.mx/sites/default/files/poligrafias/3/02-hutcheon-valdes.pdf) - Here's a PDF of the article.

There are a lot of freely available articles that might help you out, if you search for ""nostalgia"" on Google Scholar:

"I'm not an expert on the specific theme (i'm studying for my master in sociology), but i think network analysis could be an useful tool.  
Basically network analysis allows you to examinate a set of actors and their interaction through the use of graphs and statistical methods. Each actor is represented by a ""node"" and interaction between them constitutes a ""tie"".   There are ways to take in account attributes of the actor, of course. Ties are natural paths for resources - including information - that flow through the system, and they can have a great variety of attributes attached to them, as ""strength"", or carry capacity, or frequency of contact, just to make a few examples, and can be symmetric or directed.  
A (social) network analysis approach can help to identify the shortest/best path of information, as well as the crucial points that guarantee connection within the network or across the whole network.  
Moreover, actors can be anything from people to organizations to states.  
It is a fascinating methodology, and there is a book available for free on the internet, that also my professor used. It is called ""introduction to social network methods"", by Hanneman and Riddle. Try to give it a look and see if it fits your answer.

progression and novelties that the ones before it have never seen. Older generations will take new things that are seen as ""good"" in stride (microwave ovens, once upon a time), while noticing the things that are new and ""bad"" to them (put that damn phone down at the table). 

And, it's also simple Human Nature. By the time a person has reached the age of being thought of as an ""older generation"", they have matured and in many ways forgotten their own youthful behavior.  

Here's an enlightening quote from the [same study](https://scholar.colorado.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2273&amp;context=honr_theses):

“The children now love luxury; they have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for elders and love chatter in place of exercise. Children are now tyrants, not the servants of their households. They no longer rise when elders enter the room. They contradict their parents, chatter before company, gobble up dainties at the table, cross their legs, and tyrannize their teachers.""

Plato, 428 BC

"Corruption would be measured by the purpose of some sort of ritual. For example, the corruption in terms of marriages would be measured in divorce rates, at least in part.

To use my main concern, the corruption of guanxi would be measured in terms of businesses practices favoring giving power to family members at the expense of those the family member has control over (perhaps in terms of bolstering personal wealth while at the same time denying employee benefits, abusive practices by the appointed family member to the employees, etc.). In turn, these might be measured by employee experiences vs. family experiences, so perhaps it would be best to survey employees on the perception of corrupt practices.

Of course, these are only a few examples, and they may not be what sociologists generally think of. I know it's a very complex situation, especially in terms of measuring corruption, hence I wanted to ask in order to get some bearings straight.",,,,cronos844,,,1511380797,t5_2sml9,t3_7e498a,t1_dq2rz4h,2,1512908809,0,0,dq7d6nw,AskSocialScience,,,
"&gt; still don't know what you mean by that or what the relationship of ""ritual"" is to ""tradition""

I'm assuming, in my question, that ritual arises from tradition. For example, in China the contemporary practice of guanxi is a ritual that began when Confucianism, and therefore family favoritism, became dominant in China. The Confucian view is that such a practice is meant to bolster social cohesion, such that family ties are strengthened, and some other things that Confucians count as ""good.""

So, in general terms, a tradition gives meaning to some practice that in terms becomes widespread throughout a certain society, this is what a ritual is. Tradition can be defined in terms of religious beliefs (christianity being the traditional religion of the west), cultural beliefs (such as marriage), etc. My question is more China centric, so most of what I mean by tradition is Confucian beliefs and practices.

Ritual would be a set of practices that arise out of these beliefs, such as marriage (which arises out of the belief that solidifying family ties, having children, is important (in confucianism this is because such things make one more socially minded)).

Corruption would be practicing a ritual without the intended effects. So a marriage would be take place, even though the couple may plan on divorcing soon after, and that would count as a corruption of marriage. Of course, this goes into some philosophy stuff, and what kind of standard one has does go into defining corruption.

Perhaps a better question, and one that I would need to look into to help me understand my own question is: How do people generally look at as corruption in China, and what do sociologists do in terms of looking at China?",,,,cronos844,,,1511381935,t5_2sml9,t3_7e498a,t1_dq393g7,2,1512909327,0,0,dq7e7qp,AskSocialScience,,,

"Information science is what you're searching for.

Information science encompasses more than what you describe, but it also specifically deals with managing information in organisations. How can information be passed in the right format at the right time and to the right person?

Wait, wikipedia describes it much better (emphasis is mine):

&gt; Information science is a field primarily concerned with the analysis, collection, classification, manipulation, storage, *retrieval, movement,* dissemination, and protection of information. Practitioners within and outside the field study application and usage of knowledge in organizations along with the interaction between people, organizations, and any existing information systems with the aim of creating, replacing, improving, or understanding information systems. Historically, information science is associated with computer science, library science, and telecommunications. However, information science also incorporates aspects of diverse fields such as archival science, cognitive science, commerce, *law,* museology, *management,* mathematics, philosophy, *public policy,* and social sciences.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_science

I did a minor from the Information Sciences bachelor. The courses were called things like: Organisations &amp; IT; Strategic Management &amp; IT and; Information Systems. I combined public governance and organisational sciences in my bachelor and specifically chose these organisation-related Information Science courses to compliment my knowledge on the IT side. That information science bachelor had lots more courses like webdesign, data modeling, multiple programming courses and also courses that dealt with cognitive and interaction topics. Information science really deals with how humans (and organisations) deal with information and interact with information devices. Even a bit of psychology is touched upon.

So, concluding. Information science is quite broad, but I think it encompasses what you are looking for.

If you're specifically looking into the flow of information in political and bureaucratic organisations, I suggest you look for studies that combine government or political science with information science.",,,,Captain_Jack_Falcon,,,1511387321,t5_2sml9,t3_7es5ex,t3_7es5ex,16,1512911896,0,0,dq7j5lb,AskSocialScience,,,

"I would challenge your assumption. 

 It really depends on product category.   There might be more variety and advertising towards women for things like clothes, but what about cars? Beer? Sports? Video games?

Marketing is a function of 'want satisfaction' by means of differentiation.  So where there is a large 'want' - it'll tend towards more brands and subsequently more competition and advertising.

Now, this leads to questions about why men and women have different needs/wants but that's a different question.

This is related to my area of research so if you want to know more just ask.

"Rather than looking at quantitative/numerical evidence of ""off-the-books"" abortions (which would be, as you mentioned, difficult to obtain data on), it is 'common knowledge' that regardless of the laws/restrictions on abortion- *abortions STILL happen*- and no law that restricts or bans the procedure will deter pregnant women from seeking any means possible. 

Pro-life (or anti-abortion) camps like to imagine that by restricting or outright banning abortion, it will lead to fewer abortions, but this is simply incorrect and silly. **Women will always seek abortion**- which is why it is necessary to provide professional abortion care. Without it, women will resort to ""illegal"" (dangerous/DIY) means of aborting their babies...which greatly increases a woman's chances of death and other health complications.

"Good comments.  It is a complex issue.

&gt;However- the problem with rape being framed as a problem of male lust...(is) used to excuse or justify male predatory behavior...

Fully agree. And an expansion of this is that given that society agrees that rape is a bad thing and that we need to discourage it, do we want to put out any information, even if it is true, that dilutes or hinders the message?  (A rough analogy might be  *substance abuse educators* admitting that some heroin users limit their habit to recreational use.  This is true, but conceding this info is not helpful in drug education, logically leading some people to misjudge heroin's extreme addictiveness.)

The murky factor of lust can complicate judging the severity of some rape cases.  A key point, it seems, is that there is arguably a big difference between lust and the elements of predatory rapes *(e.g., premeditated rape)* such as domination, demeaning or taunting behavior, perhaps even infliction of pain.  These elements arguably involve *malicious intent.*

&gt;However, we must not assume that male lust is inherently ""biological"" and therefore inevitable...

Interesting thought.  I have not heard of the first part before.  Re the second part, of course acting out male lust should not be argued to be ""inevitable,"" people need to--and can--control urges.  But on the first part, I disagree.

&gt;Rather, male ""lust"" and its association with sexual entitlement/sexual violence stems from how we socially condition boys...

Are you opposing a combination of the two factors? Asserting that *male lust,* as expressed in acting out (""stud"" behavior) or perhaps inappropriate behavior toward women, is really only an outcome of socialization?   I  would think it's something like 60% biological/40% social conditioning??  Or 50/50.  (Just throwing out numbers; I have no evidence to refer to.)  Is there some sort of empirical evidence that informs the topic either way?    If we continue on this we ought to compare male vs female lust--not a topic I have any expertise in.

It also seems the whole phenomenon of LGBT--I guess the acronym is a bit longer now--makes the *social conditioning* perspective all the more complex.  It used to be  primarily *hetro male* rapes *hetro female*, and some male on male rape.  How many different rape scenarios are there now?

"Sorry, let me clarify:

1. The pro-life conservative position is that the life of a fetus and of an adult woman have equivalent value. 
2. When there are legal restrictions on abortion, a certain number of dangerous illegal abortions occur as a result (because, as you say, women will always seek abortions), and a certain number of safer legal abortions are prevented. 
3. Pro-life conservatives see themselves as being committed to saving lives. If a law against abortion, for example, prevents 100 safe legal abortions but ""causes"" 90 illegal abortions and 5 maternal deaths, then 5 ""lives"" are ""saved"", and the law is, in their view, indisputably good. 
4. If you want to argue about abortion with pro-life conservatives, then it's not enough to just say that ""women will always seek abortions.""

"I feel like your mis-representing economists here... From what I've seen the field is actually working to address its major issues in regards to issues such as the problems with Olympian rationality with fields such as behavioural economics and experimental economics. 

The real problem is your confusing politics which claims to have the backing of economics and actual economics. Economics as a field on a uni campus is about understanding how the interactions that make up the production and distribution of goods works, it's been moving that way for a while and the closer you get to an area of professional economics the more politics is frowned upon. Meanwhile, the economics that people actually see is filtered by politicians either getting an economist with a particular political bent to back what they're saying or often enough just doing their own thing and making it look like economics. 

That being said, economics is still a social science so you've got some fundamental issues preventing it from truly being a hard science. An inability to preform experiments(with an actual economy, experimenting on human action and extrapolating is a thing, an inability to control for variables aside from pure luck(Aus's GFC stimulus's effect being indistinguishable from that of China), just having to wait/pray for something to break current models before they can be fixed/improved and the sheer complexity of the system needing you to rely on aggregates and assumptions..

"Equilibrium theory largely derives from trying to apply the same tools of statistical analysis that were derived from Boltzmann to analyze problems of entropy. In fact the formula used by Samuelson is identical to Gibbs heat transfer equation except one of the letters used to denote a variable is changed. 

Similarly proof of the Nash Equilibrium and General Equilibrium are derived from a mathematical proof that a curve will have at least one fixed point that will attract all vectors into it (a real world example is a bowl with a marble in it. if the bowl is disturbed the marble will move but ultimately come to rest at the bottom of the bowl. this is a fixed point or stable equilibrium). Fixed point problems are a large set of problems used in physics but in nonlinear problems they are often considered something of a special case or an exceptional kind of problem. Most problems in economics (and in the world) are nonlinear and it is a common criticism that economics is dominated by fixed point problems because they are solvable not because they apply to the systems under investigation. In fact this is more or less Kenneth Arrow's career arc. He makes is career showing that General Equilibrium can be solved and then spends the rest of his career showing that the conditions for solving General Equilibrium are so unusual that they only apply in special cases. 

Equilibrium theory dominates economics and is very useful for allocation problems. That said many of the mathematical economists in the field that work in cross disciplinary areas or come from physics or computational backgrounds feel that the tools of equilibrium analysis are wrongly applied to dynamic and evolving systems. Physicists, ecologists, and other branches of science have largely turned to computational simulations to work on these problems but economics has been slow to accept agent based modelling as valid.

Although I have to admit I'm surprised theirs no behavioural economists or anything apart from mainstream, ik of two uni's(the ones I'm looking at), both of them have about 4-5 behavioural economists out of about 30 professors(So 1/6 as it stands have some experience), which uni is it?

To add a bit of grounding to my claim about behavioural economics being increasingly promoted.

"I think the key detail is that subcultural groups have more high context situations, and interactions between people from different subcultures tend towards low context. Close analysis of the supposed ""low context"" Northern European business people indicates [that some of them operate mainly in high context mode among themselves](http://pure.au.dk/portal/files/36316405/north_european_business_cultures.pdf).

Let's examine high and low context culture in British society for a moment as an example. When a Geordie auto mechanic and a London stockbroker converse they probably end up in a low context mode, while any two Peers in the House of Lords would have a high context interaction. The amount of context they have available is a function of how close their cultural experience is. Occupation, education, and religious group membership can cause as intense cross-cultural interactions [as nationality](https://books.google.com/books?id=V-vGMNell8MC&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;ots=cb4Vi5llS2&amp;dq=does%20cross%20class%20interaction%20have%20high%20context&amp;pg=PA133#v=onepage&amp;q=does%20cross%20class%20interaction%20have%20high%20context&amp;f=false). I speculate that any society where most people are illiterate and there are few distinct subcultures is probably very high context, but I'm not aware of any research on this. 

Monoculturalism increases the potential for high context interactions in a society, and multiculturalism pushes towards lower context situations. Modern societies are trending towards pluralism, and away from cultural purity. [""No modern open society can exist as ethnically pure.

"OK, so I've read through a lot of your links as best I can. Granted, I didn't read through them all, but I don't have the time.

I just...don't understand a lot of the arguments. Full disclosure, I am an ecologist, so maybe I'm biased more towards Diamond's way of thinking.

I saw arguments about ignoring agency of the people involved, or the importance of individuals, or the fact that Native Americans did have advanced societies. I just don't see how that takes away from Diamond's arguments. Yes, Native Americans played roles in the European expansion, but...Europeans *did* conquer. Yes, you can analyze the actions of individuals and question what would happen if something changed, but the momentum of the age was there. That's a common thing is science. I'm particularly thinking of when many people come up with the same idea at the same time in science. Or when multiple empires decide to expand to the New World....sure, if Cortez had died, maybe things would be different. But I'd bet it's more likely we'd just be discussing someone else's name that did pretty much the same stuff.

One link in there did admit that agricultural animals was a big difference, especially in the use of the wheel. That, in my opinion, is the biggest one in GG&amp;S. Even if not every disease Diamond points to as a major factor is zoonotic, some of them are, and Europeans had plenty of them which we may never know the full effects of. It's a big factor.

This is where I will fully admit my ignorance: I've heard, but don't know enough to claim is absolutely true, that even before Europeans settled America in great numbers, the Native Americans on the East Coast had a drastic population decline. That may or may not have been related to early Europeans contacting them, but: when you hear hooves, think horses, not zebras.

I found your livinganthropology.com link particularly unenlightening. In my mind, the author did not actually refute a single thing, just sounded angry. Especially when the author got snarky about ""Collapse"" and ""The Worst Mistake"" being agriculture. ""Collapse"" is about the ramifications of what we do and how we are now able to be aware of them. ""The Worst Mistake"" is about the ultimate consequences of what we have done. GG&amp;S was trying to explain *how* we got to a certain point in history. I don't see how any of them are in conflict.

One reddit comment in the links you cited called Diamond out on bad science. I think this, for me, finally made sense to me that there is a core philosophical difference being debated here. That comment said that Diamond pre-supposed a conclusion and picked data that supported it. Instead, he should have looked at the data and drawn a conclusion from that. When put that simply, that's true.

But it becomes more complicated when you increase scale. It is impossible to study every little bit of it. So we can look at trends we observe and attempt to explain them. That is essentially how the entire fields of ecology and evolution work: we see something and it's demonstrably a general trend in the system...what data makes that make sense?

So Diamond started with the question: Why do Europeans have so much cargo? That was demonstrably a trend in history. And he made an attempt to explain that at broad strokes. Because, again, that is how entire biological fields work. It's not ""good science"" unless it explains general trends. If it's not widely applicable, it's not interesting, it will never get published, it's not good science. It's niche. It's descriptive, not conceptual. So Diamond did his best to explain the trend.

Sorry for what ended up to be a super long rant. And I don't mean to be confrontational. But I've spent my free moments throughout today reading your links and I just simply don't understand most of the major criticisms. Can you help clarify?

"If you’re talking up to date research there really aren’t any strong arguments for inequality. 

If you want a theoretical argument, Durkheim’ s functionalist perspective would say that society pays higher valued careers more money because of the valuable things they provide to that society.

So doctors and lawyers provide a “good” that our society places a high value on and they are compensated highly for it. If they were not, functionalism says that no one (or significantly less people) would want to be a doctor or a lawyer because their contribution to society would not be valued or rewarded as much.

"Most of what I've come across suggests [income inequality is the effect of property inheritance](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~bowles/2002JEP.pdf).

What's interesting is looking at hunter gather societies that do have large inequalities, such as the St'at'imc or agricultural societies that don't have large inequalities such as the (post-great Law of Peace / pre Beaver Wars) Haudenosaunee (see Graeber's Debt for a possible explanation for this). What are the institutional differences? It's also interesting to reverse the question and consider in a state agriculture society what institutional forms would result in lower levels of inequality (hint: they have high levels of redistribution)? Samuel Bowles (cited above) makes the argument that internet culture and open source has many resemblances to hunter gather social organisation.

"OK so, the problem is that there's no way to fit all the info into a sub-reddit post, which really requires its own book (or stack of books) because he is literally covering ALL of human history. So I'll list these objections boiled down to their very basic points.

-Technology (Guns and steel): Diamond makes it seem like the Europeans came in and just steamrolled the Native Americans, specifically because of the items mentioned in the title. With guns and steel, it was not actually clear that these were everywhere superior enough to be the decisive factor. Early guns were in fact pretty inaccurate and prone to breaking, plus you need a constant supply of gunpowder. Secondly, Native Americans widely adopted guns when it became advantageous to do so. Europeans often traded or simply provided guns to their native allies. Similarly with steel, the Europeans themselves frequently abandoned it when it was disadvantageous as with the Spanish who adopted Inca cloth armor. Basically, Diamond has a Civ tech-tree view of technology. See, e.g.,

[BH thread on Cajamarca](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2bv2yf/guns_germs_and_steel_chapter_3_collision_at/)

-Germs: Now this is the most realistic point to me at least because the population collapse in the Americas was absolutely devastating and very clearly linked to European disease. However, Europeans were still largely outnumbered early in the conquest despite the disease and it is clear that disease affected areas differentially. Paleopathology is very far from what I know, though, so I'll just mention that a recent revisionist book [Beyond Germs](https://muse.jhu.edu/book/41572) has been published on this.

-Agency: The issue is not whether one or another military leader led the armies or something like that. There are 2 points. 1. What side, or whether, certain Native American groups chose to fight on. Outnumbered and without a clear advantage in technology (or where Natives had adopted the very same technology) in many places, the Europeans had to rely on native allies. Diamond ignores this when it was frequently the decisive military factor. 2. Why the Europeans? Diamond seems to assume that whenever a society gets more advanced tech, it will inevitably seek to expand outward without restraint. So he has to explain this by saying that countries like China lost their edge because of geographical factors, but Blaut argues this misrepresents the geography of Europe vs. China.",,,,Snugglerific,,,1510130285,t5_2sml9,t3_7b9ssp,t1_dpi26cs,1,1512421812,0,0,dpil3vy,AskSocialScience,,,
"It depends on the sources of inequality. A lot of inequality in developing countries is due to state capture and excessive rent seeking. This means you have inequality, without growth or efficiency gains. So there's really no upside in those cases. However, inequality is also a side effect of market reforms and creating incentives for economic growth, especially in developing economies.

Lets take a look at China. Here is a [graph](http://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Highlights%20&amp;%20Features/Poverty/ChinaGini.jpg) with the trend in the GINI-coefficient over time. It has clearly increased. Why? Prior to the reforms in the 1980s, its agricultural sector was collectivised. This meant that all farmers got similar compensation, unrelated to their productivity. So there was very little incentive for innovation or productivity gains. Everybody was equal, but everybody was poor. After the agricultural reforms, farmers were allowed to keep some of their surplus. This meant that productive farmers became richer. Instead of just having poor farmers, you now had rich farmers *and* poor farmers. Economic inequality started to grow. But this inequality was caused by incentives to be productive and indeed lead to a surge in productivity growth. These agricultural reforms often seen as one of the major causes of Chinese take off, even though they lead to inequality. This rippled out to the rest of the economy; entrepreneurs were allowed to keep their surplus, which created an incentive for them to innovate and grow the overall economy. It can be better for some people to get rich first, and to have inequality, then for everybody to be poor but equal.

It is important however, to distinguish productive and unproductive drivers of inequality. Even in developed countries, inequality creates incentives to innovate and be productive. One of the reasons why Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were successful is because they created products that consumers wanted. Why not reward them for those efforts? This is also known as [Schumpterian rent.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schumpeterian_rent) However, the same Bill Gates then likely abused his monopoly position to limit competition. Processes like this increase inequality (because competition would reduce Microstoft's rents) without leading to a positive outcomes (innovation). Similarly, and this is what a lot of the research you cite in your original post points towards, excessive inequality might be self-perpetuating. Then the rich get richer, not because they are more productive or more innovative, but simply because they were rich in the first place.

Edit: As always, its good to think about this marginally. Inequality by itself is not bad, but on the margins, most countries probably have inequality that's too high.

"There are bound to be lists , like [this one from a Harvard symposium on social sciences](https://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~socsci/Documents/HardProbsSocSciSummaryResultsandPollText_31March2011.pdf), but I'm unsure whether general lists they gotten much traction in sociology. Following is a guess about the reasons as someone with a master's in sociology.

Sociological questions are less about the ""big unknown"" and more about refinement because people have prior knowledge about their lives. In other words, we have fewer questions where the answer truly seems unsolvable for long enough to be widely recognized as an open question.

Another reason for lack of lists is that they might seem unimportant when every empirical answer is doomed to change, both because of local differences and because people change their behaviour after reflecting on the answers. Results from earlier times, other countries or circles of life are useful as hypotheses and for comparison but you'd still need to research the same question locally to know what parts of the answers were applicable.

"There's evidence that they do, at least when they have a moral conviction about whatever they're doing.  For instance, the classic Milgram experiments seemed to demonstrate that people will follow the orders of an authority in most cases, even when the authority demands that they do patently immoral things.  But recent studies seem to show this isn't the case, since no one actually evaluated whether people thought of their actions as moral or immoral (e.g. Skitka et al. 2005).  So, for example, having a moral conviction against torture makes subjects more resistant to majority influence.  When study confederates express positive views on torture, the subjects with higher moral conviction resisted changing their views, while those with less moral conviction changed their views in response to the peer pressure (Aramovich et al. 2012).

"I never claimed that it is the sole reason for innovation. I am not saying people are just selfish actors out for their own again. Financial incentives don't account for why Apple or Microsoft exist. But it plays *a* role for sure.

Again, consider consider the collectivised farms in China. There was little relationship between the inputs of farmers and their compensation. There was no possibility to be fired. People only worked for the ""collective good."" This was terrible for productivity. China's farms were more productive in 1949, before the revolution, than in 1978. Then what happened? A single village decided to (illegally) carve up the land they collectively owned into individual plots. Families were allowed to keep the surplus they created on their own plot. Then what?

 &gt; A rapid turnaround followed. The farmers of Xiaogang immediately became more productive. “Now is different from the past,” one said. “We work for ourselves.” Working their own plots of land, they could see a direct link between their effort and their rewards. Any of their output beyond what they owed the state they now retained to use for themselves or to sell. The amount of land planted in rice nearly doubled in one year, and the village began producing a rice surplus. As a farmer said, “You can’t be lazy when you work for your family and yourself.”

So what happened with output? It rose enormously. There was no more hunger. Everybody was better off, because everybody became more productive. But it inevitably creates inequality. Some people are more productive than others. Some people come up with better ideas than others. Some people just work harder than others. But if everybody was better off than before, why is it a bad thing that those who do their job better than their neighbour also get a little more money?

The Chinese government under Deng adopted this view, and got rid of collectivised farming over the 1980s. The number of rural poor fell by 170 million between 1978 and 1984.

I am not at all claiming poor people are poor because they do not work hard. I am not saying there should be no social safety net or that there would be zero innovation without financial incentives. But market reform and the personal incentives they created were massive drivers of both inequality and living standards.

"Relative deprivation is a term that describes when individual expectations about economic conditions diverges from economic realities. 

https://jspp.psychopen.eu/article/view/750/html (Pettigrew 2017)

"" Instead of absolute deprivation, social psychologists stress the importance of relative deprivation. Disappointing comparisons to relevant referents is often more significant than factual changes (Pettigrew, 2015, 2016; Smith, Pettigrew, Pippin, &amp; Bialosiewicz, 2012). What voters think is true is more important in elections than the actual truth.

Trump adherents feel deprived relative to what they expected to possess at this point in their lives and **relative to what they erroneously perceive other “less deserving” groups have acquired.** Rapidly rising costs of housing and prescription drugs have aggravated their financial concerns. Their savings may not allow the type of ideal retirements they had long envisioned. And hopes for their children advancing beyond their status and going to college are being dashed by rising tuitions.""

"but still bound up in this analysis is a Manichean collectivism vs. private property assertion (decollectivization spurred growth). in the context of global capitalism and individualism - neither of which are inherent to the human species - the range of possible alternatives to private property becomes much smaller. in a globally interconnected system, even if one's theoretical predisposition is towards collectivism, praxis is incredibly difficult due to outside pressures. but that doesn't mean that personal incentives *must* be present to create growth and innovation. it can be there but that's mostly contextual; context can be changed. 

my question will always be: ""was decollectivization the only non-violent means to increase productivity? was it simply a matter of context creating a *perceived* lack of alternatives? are there historical examples wherein collectivized farming was sufficiently productive because different - non-material - incentives (or world-views) resulted in increased productivity and innovation?"" 

also, there's a little cognitive dissonance in your responses. you ask ""why is it a bad thing that those who do their job better than their neighbour get a little more money?"" well, you outlined it in your previous response. they are more likely to conceal their practices, often stymying innovation, to ensure they maintain competitive advantages. those competitive advantages then manifest in generational inequalities within stratified societies. power imbalances then shape the types of questions we're seeking to answer, which rarely benefit those suffering from the effects of inequality (unless they greatly benefit those in power as well).

"How do you miss Nash and Von Nuemann while wrong a history of game theory?  You over politicalize it’s history in general.  You’re also missing it’s explosion in IO.

&gt;Secondly the core of game theory is the payoff matrix. This is a very simple concept and easy to use in experimental situations. Experimental games can be set up with things people actually value such as money to test behavioural interactions. Because the payoff matrix is both simple and flexible it makes experimental design relatively easy and modelling fairly trivial.

This doesn’t really make sense.  Payoff matrices only make sense in games with finite actions and players.  They are really just a way of representing the more fubdemental concept of a utility function.  

&gt;Nash equilibrium is typically treated as a compatible concept to Pareto efficiency

"I think the honest answer to your question is that we don't know and we currently don't really have a great way to find out. We simply don't have good information about the mental state of individuals who die by suicide at their index event.

As random_number_string cited from [Bostwick, et. al.](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2016.15070854), ~60% of individuals died by suicide at index (e.g., they died on their first attempt). That means that even if we had information on the mental state of each of the survivors, we'd only have 40% of the overall sample. Since we have no way of knowing whether those who died by suicide on their first attempt are meaningfully different from those who did not die on their first attempt, we can't generalize from one to the other.

The high subsequent mortality of individuals with a history of suicide attempt tends to suggest, if anything, that the opposite might be true. The Bostwick review suggests that the majority of folks (81.8%!) that survived their first attempt went on to die by suicide within a year. So, although it may be the case that folks report regret after an attempt, the numbers suggest that many will go on to attempt again.

There is a more serious caution with respect to suicide research that should be noted, however. Suicide is a statistically rare event with no very strong predictors [AHRQ report pdf](https://www.ahrq.gov/downloads/pub/prevent/pdfser/suicidser.pdf). Although researchers have made increasing strides in identifying individuals who are *at risk* for suicide, identifying people who will eventually go on to die by suicide remains an elusive goal [McCarthy et. al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26066914).

From a theoretical perspective, [Joiner](https://psy.fsu.edu/faculty/joinert/joiner.dp.php) has argued that suicide is a function of three factors: thwarted belongingness (feeling disconnected from social support), perceived burdensomeness (feeling that you are dragging down others around you), and acquired capability (habituation to pain or other reduction in the fear of death). I think it would be a disservice to say that folks that are attempting suicide are not thinking rationally, but I think it could certainly be argued that short-term lack of perspective contributes to suicide risk (e.g., risk of suicide heightens under substance use [Wilcox et. al. pdf](https://msrc.fsu.edu/system/files/Wilcox%20et%20al%202004%20Association%20of%20alcohol%20and%20drug%20use%20disorders%20and%20completed%20suicide--%20an%20empirical%20review%20of%20cohort%20studies.pdf))

In any case, having said all that to say - until we have a better understanding of suicide, we probably won't be able to answer your question with any degree of certainty.",,,,superhelpfulguy,,,1511924123,t5_2sml9,t3_7fyvcm,t3_7fyvcm,3,1513109987,0,0,dqhlat8,AskSocialScience,,,

"Honestly you don't seem to have an understanding of contemporary trends in the Economics literature. Research economists at the forefront of the field do not seriously consider Marxism any more than a research psychologist considers Freudianism. They do not care about being 'left-wing' or 'right-wing' either, they care about using the most up to date and rigorous models. 

It's particularly damning that you think Economics is a 'closed academic world' because that can't be further from the truth. I am fortunate enough to go to a research university where our economics faculty use neural systems models and neuroimaging (like fMRI and EEG) to rigorously study decision making in the brain. They're borrowing ideas and methods from biology, psychology, and medical imaging to test predictions of game theory (and psychologists are borrowing game theory as well!). If you are actually interested in knowing more about this, I'd recommend checking out the websites of Colin Camerer or Antonio Rangel and reading one of their papers. 

Even if you want to ignore the behavioral economists because they're, in a sense, academic rebels,  you'd be hard pressed to find a more 'classically' inclined (published!) economist who doesn't believe in game theory. I've studied under some economic historians who not only have a deep understanding of and respect for game theoretic models, but also use them often enough. I would gladly PM you more about them if you'd like.

Your friend did not commit academic suicide, as you call it, for going against the grain. His paper will in all likelihood be rejected during peer review, unless he came up with a genius mathematical proof or undeniable regressions to back up his ridiculous claim...

What I think you may be overlooking is that there may or may not be a ""best source"" or ""quality authors"" for your purpose. Scholarship is about exploration and learning, not validation and confirmation.

You're exploring a topic, not using a source to confirm what you think it is (confirmation bias). 

Part of exploration is validating sources. And if you don't know how to validate a source, then simply say that. 

That's what I think you're asking. Not really sure due to your nebulous phrasing.

"Although I agree with you that a left right divide is used in political science, the complete dismissal of both the Nolan chart and conceptualisation according to government role seems a bit excessive to me.

You are right in the sense that the statement about most polical scientist might be put a bit too surely.

That being said, I stand by my point (that I didn't make that clear before) that the left-right divide is hardly a useful classification. In my opinion a classification based on party families(for parties) or the Nolan chart(for voters and parties), would almost always be more appropriate than one based on a singular scale.

"Game theory's popularity has a couple of major themes. It's a [complicated history](http://www.econ.canterbury.ac.nz/personal_pages/paul_walker/gt/hist.htm).

First off game theory is very compatible with conventional Walrasian theory. Nash equilibrium is typically treated as a compatible concept to Pareto efficiency. It's also often used as a way to link individual preferences with macro behaviour. Game theory was also championed by right wing think tanks such as the RAND corporation in the post war period and made significant inroads into economic departments. Most of this work came out of the strategic arms race of the cold war period and theories of mutual deterence and cooperation. That said probably the first major papers in economics using game theory were by Thomas Schelling so it's hard to say that it had a strictly right wing flavor in it's early incarnations. Schelling isn't easily pinned down as a right wing thinker even thought he was very involved with the state departement. 

Secondly the core of game theory is the payoff matrix. This is a very simple concept and easy to use in experimental situations. Experimental games can be set up with things people actually value such as money to test behavioural interactions. Because the payoff matrix is both simple and flexible it makes experimental design relatively easy and modelling fairly trivial. 

During the behavioural revolution left wing economists such as Bowles and Gintis recognized that game theory was a platform in which experimental proof which overturned the [walrasian 'homo economicus' model could be proven](http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1083&amp;context=econ_workingpaper). By applying the computational game theory approaches of iterative games that followed Axelrod's famous tournaments with experimental conditions with a growing body of research from more sociological and psychological economists such as Ernst Fehr, Simon Gacher, Richard Thaler etc. Having empirical evidence of human behaviour with a supportive modelling and predictive platform in social situations gave behavioural economists an inroad to challenge the dominant paradigm of Walrasian theory. I've heard [Herbert Gintis talk explicitly about this strategy in talks](https://youtu.be/pbjOEqFYJ7Y?t=1159). 

So game theory has had a lot of use in the politics of defining the economic paradigm. It's hard to pin down to a specifically left or right agenda but has been useful for both sides in pushing and reinforcing certain concepts. The vast majority of game theory work now tends to support more socially progressive and altrusitic positions. It's probably notable to mention that [Bowles and Gintis started using it](http://www.umass.edu/preferen/You%20Must%20Read%20This/Gintis%20Colander%20Interview%202004.pdf), and Bowles still does, to explore explicitly Marxist concepts (it's fun reading Bowles working papers and the published versions and seeing any references to Marx edited out).

"You're free to choose your subject in Germany, but if more people want to take a specific subject it gets a numerus clausus (NC), so you have to have a certain grade on your abitur (high school diploma) to be eligible. These mostly start at 2,7 and go up to 1,0 (on a Scale from 4,0 up to 1,0 - the best). Psychology is a good example of having a high NC when I started studying it was like 1,2 or so. There are a few ways to lower the NC e.g. serving in the army or the social service sector or simply taking a ""waiting semester"". Other than that you can try at another University, especially the ones in Eastern Germany have low NC.

University isn't completely free as you still have to pay around 250€ per semester, but most of that is for public transportation and the rest goes into a social fund.

"I agree that aid should go to middle and lower class families, but a disproportionate amount of the subsidy goes to kids from high income households, as they are much more likely to attend college and attend more expensive colleges than lower income students.

Colleges are the biggest price discriminators of basically any industry in the world, charging radically different prices based on the customers' ability to pay. Getting rid of that ability favors students who currently shoulder more of the load. A more effective and efficient process would target students who have trouble paying for college and offer aid directly to any school, not just public schools, allowing them more choice and drastically reducing the overall cost of the program.

"There are some of the arguments against subsidized college.  (For purposes of answering your question ""subsidized"" can mean literally making it free, paying part of the cost, or lowering the cost of student loans.)

One argument is that subsidized college results in too many people studying things that don't result in a financial return on that investment (""[worthless degrees](https://mises.org/library/how-student-loans-create-demand-useless-degrees)""). [Arguably](https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21600131-too-many-degrees-are-waste-money-return-higher-education-would-be-much-better), there are many such degrees. 

Another argument is that [too many people will try go to college](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomlindsay/2014/11/28/unintended-consequences-how-the-college-for-everybody-agenda-harms-both-students-and-the-economy/#54b22a473194).

So golf, gymnastics, swimming, baseball, cheerleading, and tennis just don’t exist? You realize there are more to college athletics than just football, right?

And note, I said good PR. I didn’t say help the school turn a profit. In fact, most athletics programs actually lose money for the school. They mostly make it back off the bigger sports, like football and soccer, but most sports are not money makers. But if a school carved out a niche within a particular sport, then they will have good recruits and start bringing more positive attention to their school. University of Kentucky’s cheer program is a good example. Hell, my undergrad had a weird few years where we had a phenomenal golfer that made it to the amateur tour. That was easy free PR for the University. 

And none of what I’ve said addresses my thoughts on compensation for college athletes, or their ability to find sponsorships/profit outside of the sport.

"Let's begin by simply listing some countries that are notable for having both universal free education and some of [the highest levels of innovation per capita](http://www.wipo.int/pressroom/en/articles/2017/article_0006.html#top): Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Germany.  Austria and Norway also have universal free education, but even despite Norway's oil industry they are lagging behind their neighbors somewhat, although still ranking very high by global standards.

Now turn your attention to [this chart](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=expenditure_per_student&amp;fdim_y=education_level:4&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:SWE:GBR:DEU:FIN:FRA:USA:SVN:NLD:CHE&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false) comparing some select countries' public expenditures on tertiary education. The vertical axis is public spending per student per GDP per capita. Data from the World Bank. And before we jump to conclusions, *do* consider how these figures are skewed by the ratio of students to the total population!

As you can see, it would take an in-depth discussion to fully compare the returns on investment for each country (which I am not qualified to give). But you can hopefully see that the top performers in innovation are also the biggest spenders of public money on education. Notice how Switzerland and the Netherlands, easily some of the absolute créme de la créme countries in innovation per capita, have very high public expenditures on tertiary education while not providing free universal education. And then, how countries like Finland and Sweden, that *do* have universal free education, have similar or *lower* expenditures and are also top performers.

Finally, to support the notion that this is not just some fluke but that these efforts in spending towards education fuels the job market, have a look at some of [OECD's lists on employment levels](http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2017/indicator-a5-how-does-educational-attainment-affect-participation-in-the-labour-market_eag-2017-11-en#page1) for people with higher education.

So far, I think it's safe to say that free universal education is at a minimum not a detriment to innovation. It definitely seems to be the case that public spending on education is a significant factor for development. However, it is not clear to me whether it is better to have free universal education, or to have scholarships, or to have your citizens pay for the privilege to go to university. As some developing countries do provide their citizens with free universal education, it will be interesting to see how they develop compared to their neighbors who don't.

"It could be, yes.

Anomic suicide was theorized to be driven by alienation from society (separation from societal values, interrelationships, or goals that constrain, direct, or set goals for individual behavior ([Kushner](http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2004.053314))). Durkheim argues that, in the absence of those elements, people become aimless and life loses meaning. It's frequently portrayed as the opposite of fatalistic suicide (where everything is controlled and the person cannot escape).

It may be helpful to read some of the more recent theoretical texts on suicide. They can visit similar themes and may help to clarify some of the earlier works (keeping in mind that Durkheim wrote in the late 1800s).

"Hmm. How doctrinaire do you want to be here? I would say that one of the more interesting Marxians being published today in history would be Geoff Eley, but he has drifted away from Marxism due to his embrace of the cultural turn. More straight Marxists would be ye old British Marxists such as the recently deceased Hobsbawm. Both of my suggestions though are rather old (Hobsbawm died half a decade ago and Eley is well established). I could not say who is a famous young Marxist in history.

As far as accessing their work, there is always the library. Some of Hobsbawm's work (particularly his *Age of* series) is on Libcom. Eley's work is harder to find and you might need to interlibrary loan it. Don't by it though. Academic books are always overpriced. 

Finally, if you want to read shorter works, I would advise checking out *Radical History Review*, *Past &amp; Present*, and *Critical Historical Studies*. While none is explicitly doctrinaire Marxist, all have strong left-wing and Marxian influences. Each issue of *CHS* is sold as an ebook for like $20 books.

"You are right to point out that the parameters are limited: as I mentioned, the research contrasts non-violent maximalist movements with violent maximalist movements. 

However, this does not mean that they are comparing outright rebellion vs. issues with area to compromise. They are comparing violent vs. nonviolent movements with the end goal of the removal of incumbent national leaders, or territorial independence. There are several hundred data points, so it's not as many as you might think. The [Rose Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Revolution) is a good example of a nonviolent maximalist campaign.

In this case, Gandhi's movement is likely in the dataset, while MLK is almost certainly not. I think MLK just serves as a symbol of the philosophy behind nonviolent movements and that's why he often finds himself in these pieces -- especially those for a popular audience like the WaPo articles or the Ted Talks.

Moreover, the research compares *primarily* violent vs. *primarily* nonviolent campaigns. There are difficulties in conceptualizing campaigns as nonviolent or violent, as these two forms of resistance are not mutually exclusive (Ackerman and Kruegler, 1994). Scholars recognize this and circumvent this issue by characterizing campaigns as primarily one of these two kinds of resistance based on the frequency and importance of the resistance methods used in each campaign. So, ultimately, a subjective decision, but in cases where a primarily peaceful movement has a violent flank, it could still be characterized as nonviolent.

I think your best point is the one about the dimensionality of time within these movements. How do violent movements affect nonviolent campaigns? If a key portion about why non-violence is successful is because these campaigns are sympathetic and paint the government in a bad light, is a previous violent act required for this to take place? I'm not sure and I don't think the research addresses this, but I'll look into it more. This is fascinating, and also what /u/CharmedConflict points out in the /r/DepthHub discussion of the original comment.

What I do know that is probably true is that violent flanks are typically disadvantageous for nonviolent mass movements (though there are certainly counterexamples), which is also the question of /u/antlerbot. I'm copy-pasting this from [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/01/18/how-the-world-is-proving-mlk-right-about-nonviolence/?utm_term=.5bb89cbfb23e) with some edits:

&gt; Violent flanks may achieve some short-term process goals such as media attention, the perception of self-defense, the diffusion of an oppositional culture that builds the commitment of more radical members, or catharsis around the ability to “blow off steam.” But violent flanks typically undermine longer-term strategic goals such as maintaining an increasingly large and diverse participation base, expanding support among third parties and eliciting loyalty shifts among security forces. Violent flanks are typically associated with smaller participation rates and more homogenous participation, undermining the main advantage of using nonviolent resistance in the first place. (Chenoweth and Schock, 2015).

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Violent flanks tend to increase repression by the state, which tends to be associated with lower participation rates. (Tompkins, 2015).

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Leveraging data on urban protests by black Americans during the 1960s, Wasow convincingly shows that a higher frequency of nonviolent protests led to higher support for “civil rights” as the primary issue of public concern in the United States, whereas a higher frequency of violent protests led to greater support for “law and order” as the primary issue. After 1965, as violent protests became more common, public opinion shifted away from support for civil rights and toward support for the police response, showing how the movement had ceased to expand its appeal among crucial pillars of support. Strikingly, public opinion mattered not only in the short-term, but also in the long-term: Wasow finds that support for “law and order” was highly correlated with votes for Republican leadership, suggesting that the effects of different protest types have had lasting political effects in the United States. (Wasow, 2017)

"In political science, we measure how people associate with each other and make compromises in a political system. People with similar preferences in policy are more likely to work together. When this behavior is mapped onto a spectrum (where points closer together compromise with each other more readily than points far from each other), it can be used to predict political shifts and which policies are likely to successfully be passed in a legislature. 

Left and Right come from the French Revolutionary government, where the right supported the aristocracy and the left supported the urban workers (and the terms referred to literally which sides they sat on in the room). While these definitions do not apply now, the tradition of referring to each side as right and left seems to be mostly agreed upon. What constitutes left and right is highly dependent on where and when the question is being asked. There is a weak trend of the right being supportive of traditionalism and hierarchy with the left being supportive of novelty and dismantling hierarchy, but this is not universal and can be confusing if you try to apply it to certain political environments (many former Soviet countries do not adhere well to this trend).

Why only two sides and using a single dimensional spectrum? In a democracy, policy is passed by asking yes or no questions, which divides each individual issue into support and opposition. When you measure many issues and allow political actors to negotiate with each other, a pattern forms where actors are relatively stable in their voting behavior and fall into camps (parties) that work together in varying degrees.

"So. This is hard for me because I am Europeanist not an Americanist and I tend to focus on the 1870s after anyway, so slavery is outside of my temporal and geographic remit.

I think I can help with some older authors and some current ones, but I will note that I know most of these people through reviews rather than reading their actual work. 

If you are looking at more materialist and Marxian accounts, there are a number of ""new historians of capitalism"" who try to center slavery as the core of American capitalism. The ones that I am thinking of right now are *Empire of Cotton* and *The Half That Has Never Been Told*. To my knowledge, both has been generally well-reviewed. The latter has even been praised by Eric Foner, one of the older Marxist historians. 

While both have been well-reviewed, they have also come under criticism from a lack of theorization and, at times, factual errors. I think the best critique I have seen is Clegg's ""Capitalism and Slavery"". (Clegg is a student of Vivek Chibber, a Marxist sociologist). Although, to be blunt, Clegg does not share Eley's perspective in that I believe like Chibber he greatly rejects the cultural turn, while Eley tends to think it is fine, but has some issues. A different critique is ""Finding Value in *Empire of Cotton*"" which looks a bit more to the history of the racial capitalism idea (where capitalism and its emergence is centered in slavery) and cites a lot of Black Marxists (""C. L. R. James, Eric Williams, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Cedric Robinson"", etc.). By contrast, Clegg tends to cite a mix between sociologists, social historians, and more neoclassical economic historians (despite his own account being, I would say, clearly Marxian). 

I would advise reading those articles and from that reading the books they review and look through the footnotes. The articles are both in *Critical Historical Studies* and I am pretty sure they have other articles on slavery that might interest you. The journal as a whole more effectively mirrors Eley's perspective, because Eley's famous co-author Sewell is its editor. I am pretty sure that the two books are pretty easily available on line (if you know where to look).

There are some older historians and works that I might recommend Hadden's *Slave Patrols* looks at the institution of the slave patrol and its class connotations. Similarly, if you want to read some of the older Marxist work on slavery, you might want to read Gutman and Genovese (who is nowadays widely condemned for his paternalistic account of slavery, but his account was rooted in Marxism; he like an annoying number of Marxists, become a conservative). If you read Gutman, I would also suggest reading a bit of Fogel (*Without Contract or Consent* and *Time on the Cross*), since while both are wrong (the first undercosts the horrific brutality of slavery), they a) helped to argue that slavery was an economically efficient system and b) created a strong backlash that. For Gutman himself, I would suggest reading *Slavery and the Numbers Game* (his critique of Fogel) and *The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom*. A problem is that I could not find those anywhere online (except *Time on the Cross*, so if you don't want to invest in it, I wouldn't. If you want to read post-slavery, reconstruction work, grab Foner. 

Anyway, this is probably too long and not that helpful. I would also suggest, if you do read Eley, to read his *Forging Democracy* which is a history of the socialist and labor movement in constructing European democracy. Although he has also done work on German history, the radical right, etc. (Honestly I think the only thing he hasn't done is probably slavery.) 

Also, you might want to check out *History Workshop*, which has a free version with a lot of random left-leaning history stuff including, I believe, on slavery.",,,,Randomname64,,,1511727472,t5_2sml9,t3_7fhy6a,t1_dqdbhvr,2,1513026676,0,0,dqdf7ou,AskSocialScience,,,
